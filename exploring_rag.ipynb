      "{'category': 'Questions about God', 'sub.category': 'The Nature of God', 'question': 'What is God like?', 'answer': 'Answer\\nEvery culture in the history of the world has had some concept of what God is like. Some have assumed that God is in control of the weather and have made images of a storm god throwing lightning bolts around (Baal worship in Canaan). Some have assumed that God is very powerful, and so they worshiped the most powerful thing they could see, the sun (Ra worship in Egypt). Others have assumed that God is everywhere and therefore have worshiped everything (pantheism in Stoic philosophy). Some have assumed that God is unknowable and have turned to agnosticism or, just to cover their bases, have worshiped “An Unknown God” (Acts 17:23).\\nThe problem with each of these assumptions is that they only get part of the picture of who God is. Yes, God is in control of the weather, but He is also in control of so much more. He is powerful, but much more powerful than the sun. He is everywhere, but He also transcends everything. And, thankfully, while there are some things we don’t understand about God, He is knowable. In fact, He has revealed everything we need to know about Him in the Bible. God wants to be known (Psalm 46:10).\\nNorman Geisler and Frank Turek, in their book I Don’t Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist, state the following:\\n- Truth is discovered, not invented. It exists independent of anyone’s knowledge of it. (Gravity existed prior to Newton.)\\n- Truth is transcultural; if something is true, it is true for all people, in all places, at all times. (2+2=4 for everyone, everywhere, at every time.)\\n- Truth is unchanging even though our beliefs about truth change. (When we began to believe the earth was round instead of flat, the truth about the earth didn’t change, only our belief about the earth changed.)\\nTherefore, as we try to ascertain what God is like, we are simply trying to discover truths already there.\\nFirst, God exists. The Bible never argues for God’s existence; it simply states it. The fact that God is should be self-evident through the works He has created (Psalm 19:1-6). Genesis 1:1 says, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” This is a simple yet powerful statement. The universe includes time, space, matter, and energy, so that all discernible elements in the universe came into being by God’s decree. Albert Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity states that all time, space, and matter had a definite, simultaneous beginning. What has a beginning has a cause. That is the law of causality, and the fact of God easily explains the ultimate cause. God is the creator of all that is, and so we know something else about Him: He is almighty (Joel 1:15), He is eternally self-existent (Psalm 90:2), and He exists above and beyond all of creation (Psalm 97:9).\\nThe same God who made all things also controls those things. He is sovereign (Isaiah 46:10). He who creates an item owns it and has power to utilize it as he sees fit. The ultimate cause has ultimate authority. In Isaiah 44:24 God presents Himself as the One “who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself.” The next verse says that He “overthrows the learning of the wise and turns it into nonsense.” This is obviously a God with power to do as He pleases.\\nGod is spirit (John 4:24) and cannot be represented by any created thing; in fact, the attempt to create such a representation is blasphemous (Exodus 20:4-6). God is unchanging (Malachi 3:6). God is all-knowing (1 John 3:20) and all-present (Psalm 139:7-13). He is holy and glorious (Isaiah 6:3). He is just (Deuteronomy 32:4) and will justly judge all sin and unrighteousness (Jude 1:15).\\nThe judgment of God highlights another truth about what He is like: He is a moral being. C. S. Lewis, in Mere Christianity, makes the case that, just as there exists observable laws of nature (gravity, entropy, etc.), there are also observable laws of morality. He writes, “First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in.” Despite varied ideas about what constitutes right and wrong, there is a universal belief that right and wrong exist, and this is a reflection of the God who made us (Genesis 1:26; Ecclesiastes 3:11).\\nWhen Jesus entered our world, He showed us the Father (John 14:7-9). Through Jesus, we understand that God seeks to save the lost (Luke 19:10). He is compassionate (Matthew 14:14), He is merciful (Luke 6:36), and He is forgiving (Matthew 9:1-8). At the same time, Jesus shows us that God will judge unrepentant sin (Luke 13:5) and that God is angry with those who live falsely and refuse to acknowledge the truth (Matthew 23).\\nMost of all, Jesus showed us that God is love (1 John 4:8). It was in love that God sent His Son into the world (John 3:16). It was in love that Jesus died on the cross for sinners (Romans 5:8). It is in love that He still calls sinners to repentance to experience the grace of God and to be called the children of God (1 John 3:1).', 'source': 'https://www.gotquestions.org/what-is-God-like.html'}\n"

      "[{'category': 'Questions about People in the Bible', 'sub.category': 'New Testament Individuals', 'question': 'Who was Paul in the Bible?', 'answer': 'Answer\\r\\nThere is much we can learn from the life of the apostle Paul. Far from ordinary, Paul was given the opportunity to do extraordinary things for the kingdom of God. The story of Paul is a story of redemption in Jesus Christ and a testimony that no one is beyond the saving grace of the Lord. However, to gain the full measure of the man, we must examine his dark side and what he symbolized before becoming “the Apostle of Grace.” Paul’s early life was marked by religious zeal, brutal violence, and the relentless persecution of the early church. Fortunately, the later years of Paul’s life show a marked difference as he lived his life for Christ and for the advancement of His kingdom. \\n\\r\\nPaul was actually born as Saul. He was born in Tarsus in Cilicia, a province in the southeastern corner of modern-day Tersous, Turkey, sometime in the first decade AD. He was of Benjamite lineage and Hebrew ancestry (Philippians 3:5–6). His parents were Pharisees—fervent Jewish nationalists who adhered strictly to the Law of Moses—who sought to protect their children from “contamination” from the Gentiles. Anything Greek would have been despised in Saul’s household, yet he could speak Greek and passable Latin. His household would have spoken Aramaic, which was the official language of Judea. Saul’s family were Roman citizens but viewed Jerusalem as a truly sacred and holy city (Acts 22:22-29). \\r\\nAt age thirteen Saul was sent to Judea to learn from a rabbi named Gamaliel, under whom Saul mastered Jewish history, the Psalms, and the works of the prophets. His education would continue for five or six years as Saul learned such things as dissecting Scripture (Acts 22:3). It was during this time that he developed a question-and-answer style of teaching known in ancient times as “diatribe.” This method of articulation helped rabbis debate the finer points of Jewish law to either defend or prosecute those who broke the law. Saul went on to become a lawyer, and all signs pointed to his becoming a member of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish Supreme Court of 71 men who ruled over Jewish life and religion. Saul was zealous for his faith, and this faith did not allow for compromise. It is this zeal that led Saul down the path of religious extremism. \\r\\nIn Acts 5:27–42, Peter delivered his defense of the gospel and of Jesus in front of the Sanhedrin, which Saul would have heard. Gamaliel was also present and delivered a message to calm the council and prevent them from stoning Peter. Saul might also have been present at the trial of Stephen. He was present for his stoning and death; he held the garments of those who did the stoning (Acts 7:58). After Stephen’s death, \"a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem\" (Acts 8:1).  Saul became determined to eradicate Christians, ruthless in his pursuit as he believed he was acting in the name of God. Arguably, there is no one more frightening or more vicious than a religious terrorist, especially when he believes he is doing the will of the Lord by killing innocent people. This is exactly what Saul of Tarsus was: a religious terrorist. Acts 8:3 states, “He began ravaging the church, entering house after house, and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison.” \\r\\nThe pivotal passage in Paul’s story is Acts 9:1–22, which recounts Paul’s meeting with Jesus Christ on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus, a journey of about 150 miles. Saul was angered by what he had seen and filled with murderous rage against the Christians. Before departing on his journey, he had asked the high priest for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, asking for permission to bring any Christians (followers of “the Way,” as they were known) back to Jerusalem to imprison them. On the road Saul was caught in a bright light from heaven that caused him to fall face down on the ground. He heard the words, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” He replied, “Who are you Lord?” Jesus answered directly and clearly, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting” (verses 4–5). As an aside, this might not have been Saul’s first encounter with Jesus, as some scholars suggest that young Saul might have known of Jesus and that he might have actually witnessed His death.\\r\\nFrom that moment on, Saul’s life was turned upside down. The light of the Lord blinded him, and as he traveled on he had to rely on his companions. As instructed by Jesus, Saul continued to Damascus to make contact with a man named Ananias, who was hesitant at first to meet Saul because he knew Saul’s reputation as an evil man. But the Lord told Ananias that Saul was a “chosen instrument” to carry His name before the Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel (Acts 9:15) and would suffer for doing so (Acts 9:16). Ananias followed the Lord’s instructions and found Saul, on whom he laid hands, and told him of his vision of Jesus Christ. Through prayer, Saul received the Holy Spirit (Acts 9:17), regained his sight, and was baptized (Acts 9:18). Saul immediately went into the synagogues and proclaimed Jesus as the Son of God (Acts 9:20). The people were amazed and skeptical, as Saul’s reputation was well known. The Jews thought he had come to take away the Christians (Acts 9:21), but he had in fact joined them. Saul’s boldness increased as the Jews living in Damascus were confounded by Saul’s arguments proving that Jesus was the Christ (Acts 9:22).\\r\\nSaul spent time in Arabia, Damascus, Jerusalem, Syria, and his native Cilicia, and Barnabas enlisted his help to teach those in the church in Antioch (Acts 11:25). Interestingly, the Christians driven out of Judea by the persecution that arose after Stephen’s death founded this multiracial church (Acts 11:19–21). \\r\\nSaul took his first of three missionary journeys in the late AD 40s. As he spent more time in Gentile areas, Saul began to go by his Roman name Paul (Acts 13:9). Paul wrote many of the New Testament books. Most theologians are in agreement that he wrote Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Philemon, Ephesians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus. These thirteen “letters” (epistles) make up the “Pauline Authorship” and are the primary source of his theology. As previously noted, the book of Acts gives us a historical look at Paul’s life and times. The apostle Paul spent his life proclaiming the risen Christ Jesus throughout the Roman world, often at great personal peril (2 Corinthians 11:24–27). It is assumed that Paul died a martyr’s death in the mid-to-late AD 60s in Rome.\\r\\nSo, what can we learn from the life of the apostle Paul? First, we learn that God can save anyone. The remarkable story of Paul repeats itself every day as sinful, broken people all over the world are transformed by God’s saving grace in Jesus Christ. Some of these people have done despicable things to other human beings, while some just try to live a moral life thinking that God will smile upon them on the day of judgment. When we read the story of Paul, we are amazed that God would allow into heaven a religious extremist who murdered innocent women and children. Today, we might see terrorists or other criminals as unworthy of redemption because their crimes against humanity are just too great. The story of Paul is a story that can be told today—he isn’t worthy in our eyes of a second chance, yet God granted him mercy. The truth is that every person matters to God, from the “good, decent,” average person to the “wicked, evil,” degenerate one. Only God can save a soul from hell. \\r\\nSecond, we learn from the life of Paul that anyone can be a humble, powerful witness for Jesus Christ. Arguably, no other human figure in the Bible demonstrated more humility while sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ as Paul. Acts 20:19 tells us that he “served the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to [him] through the plots of the Jews.” In Acts 28:31, Paul shares the good news of Jesus Christ: “Boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ.” Paul was not afraid to tell others what the Lord had done for him. Paul spent all his days, from conversion to martyrdom, working tirelessly for the kingdom of God. \\r\\nFinally, we learn that anyone can surrender completely to God. Paul was fully committed to God. In Philippians 1:12–14, Paul wrote from prison, “I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.” Despite his circumstances, Paul praised God and continually shared the good news (see also Acts 16:22–25 and Philippians 4:11–13). Through his hardships and suffering, Paul knew the outcome of a life well lived for Christ. He had surrendered his life fully, trusting God for everything. He wrote, “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain” (Philippians 1:21). Can we make the same claim?', 'source': 'https://www.gotquestions.org/life-Paul.html'}, {'category': 'Questions about People in the Bible', 'sub.category': 'New Testament Individuals', 'question': 'Why was Paul in prison?', 'answer': 'Answer\\nPaul was in prison several times during his ministry, and, almost everywhere he went, there were people who wanted him in prison. It all began when Jesus confronted Saul the Pharisee on the road to Damascus and completely changed the course of Saul’s life (Acts 9:1–20). God had chosen Saul, better known to most by his Roman name Paul, for a special mission: to be the apostle to the Gentiles (Acts 9:15; Romans 11:13; Galatians 2:8). Fulfilling this calling would mean enduring much suffering (Acts 9:16), including beatings, shipwreck, stonings, and arrests for simply preaching the gospel (2 Corinthians 11:24–27). We know of three times Paul was imprisoned. Given that Paul was active in ministry for thirty-five years, he certainly could have been arrested and imprisoned at other times as well. Paul’s arrests were a result of his being faithful to God’s call on his life, not of committing evil.\\nPaul’s first recorded arrest took place in Philippi in Macedonia during his second missionary journey, sometime around AD 51. A demon-possessed slave girl kept following Paul and Silas and shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved” (Acts 16:17). The girl was disruptive and annoying, and finally Paul turned to her and commanded the demon to leave her. The girl’s owners were furious that their source of income through soothsaying was gone, so they dragged Paul and Silas before the authorities and accused them of causing public riots. The magistrate, going against Roman law, had them beaten and thrown into prison without a trial (Acts 16:23–24).\\nBut during this imprisonment, the Lord caused an earthquake. Paul’s and Silas’s chains came loose, and the prison doors swung open. When the jailer saw the doors open, he assumed the prisoners had escaped and, knowing he would be held responsible, drew out his sword to kill himself. But Paul called out to him, assuring him that all of the prisoners were still there. The jailer was so overcome with gratitude that he took Paul and Silas into his home and tended their wounds. Paul spoke to him about Jesus, and the jailer and his entire household received Jesus as Lord and were baptized (Acts 16:31–34). Paul’s first imprisonment resulted in glory for God and the salvation of many.\\nPaul’s second recorded arrest, which took place in Jerusalem, was prophesied beforehand (Acts 21:11); even with the warning, Paul chose to continue toward the capital. James and the elders of the church in Jerusalem greeted him warmly. They also informed him of Jewish believers who thought Paul was teaching other Jews to reject their Jewish heritage. Hoping to demonstrate this was not true, and at the advice of the elders, Paul joined four men in their purification rights. This required a visit to the temple. But some non-believing Jews from Asia recognized Paul in the temple and stirred up the crowds against him, shouting, “Fellow Israelites, help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place” (Acts 21:28). None of this was true, but, nonetheless, the people rioted and tried to kill Paul. Paul was quickly arrested by the Romans and put in jail. This occurred sometime around AD 57.\\nThe commander of the regiment in charge of Paul allowed him to speak to the crowd. Acts 22 records Paul’s sermon, which included his own personal testimony of encountering Jesus on the road to Damascus. The crowd shouted for Paul’s death (Acts 22:22). The Roman commander sent Paul to the barracks with orders that he be flogged and interrogated (Acts 22:24). Unbeknownst to the commander, Paul was a Roman citizen, and therefore it was illegal for him to be flogged without having been found guilty. On this occasion, Paul spared himself a beating by bringing the fact of his Roman citizenship to the attention of a centurion. Alarmed, and still unsure why the Jews were accusing Paul, the commander decided to send Paul to the Sanhedrin, the Jewish governing body (Acts 22:30).\\nThe next day, Paul made his defense before the Sanhedrin, saying he was on trial for his hope in the resurrection of the dead. The Pharisees held to the doctrine of resurrection, but the Sadducees did not; thus, Paul leveraged the disagreements within the Sanhedrin to defend his belief in the gospel (Acts 23:6–8). Some of the Pharisees rose to Paul’s defense, and the ensuing dispute within the Sanhedrin became so violent that the Roman commander ordered Paul to be taken back to the barracks for his own safety. “The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, ‘Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome’” (Acts 23:11).\\nWhile Paul was in prison in Jerusalem, some of the Jews conspired to assassinate him, but the plot was discovered by Paul’s nephew, who warned the Roman commander. Paul was then taken by night under heavy guard to Caesarea where his imprisonment continued. Paul soon stood trial before the governor Felix. Felix was seemingly convicted by the message of the gospel but responded in fear rather than repentance (Acts 24:25). Felix kept Paul in prison for two more years, hoping for Paul to offer a bribe (Acts 24:26). As a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul in prison when he was succeeded by Porcius Festus around AD 59 (Acts 24:27).\\nIn Jerusalem, the chief priests and Jewish leaders, who still hated Paul, presented their case against him before Festus and asked that Paul be transferred to Jerusalem. In reply, Festus invited some of the Jewish leaders to come to Caesarea where Paul was being held. Another trial followed, but none of the charges could be proved. Festus wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, so he asked if Paul would go to Jerusalem to stand trial there. Paul refused, appealing to Caesar instead. Before Paul could be sent to Rome, King Agrippa arrived in Caesarea. Festus asked for Agrippa’s advice, and Paul stood before Agrippa—another opportunity to share the gospel (Acts 26). Because Paul had appealed to Caesar, he was then sent on to Rome around AD 60 (Acts 27).\\nAlthough a prisoner in Rome, Paul was allowed to live in a house and receive care and provision from friends and family (Acts 28:30–31). He was under this house arrest for two years. Paul “welcomed all who came to see him. He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with all boldness and without hindrance!” (Acts 28:31). It was during this house arrest that Paul wrote the books of Ephesians, Philemon, Colossians, and Philippians. Again, God did not waste His servant’s suffering but inspired Paul to write part of what would become our New Testament. Paul was released from this imprisonment sometime around AD 62.\\nPaul’s last arrest, which is not detailed in Acts, occurred somewhere around AD 66. Once again, he was held under Roman guard, but this time he was confined to a jail cell. From there, Paul penned his second letter to Timothy (2 Timothy 2:8–9). In the last of Paul’s “prison epistles,” his tone is weary, and he realizes the end of his earthly ministry is coming soon (2 Timothy 4:6–8). He encourages Timothy to keep the faith (2 Timothy 1:13; 2:2; 4:2) and to come to see him if at all possible (2 Timothy 4:9, 13). Paul was feeling lonely as many of his co-workers had gone elsewhere for ministry; at least one had even deserted Paul (2 Timothy 4:10–12, 16–18).\\nIn prison, Paul wrote with hopeful confidence, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing” (2 Timothy 4:7–8). He claimed, “The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen” (2 Timothy 4:18). At the end of his third imprisonment, Paul was martyred by the Roman Empire. He was, indeed, brought safely to be with the Lord (Philippians 1:21–23; 2 Corinthians 5:8). No more would evil men attack him. He would never see a prison again.\\nPaul’s life after conversion is a picture of total devotion to the purposes and plans of God. His words in Galatians 2:20 explain how Paul viewed his life: “I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.” Paul could endure imprisonment as an innocent man because he counted his life as nothing (Acts 20:24; Philippians 3:7–10). Even though treated unjustly by the nation and people he loved, Paul continued to preach the gospel and used every opportunity to share the truth of Jesus, even with prison guards (Philippians 4:22).\\nPaul was in prison because people “loved darkness instead of light” (John 3:19) and they “suppress the truth by their wickedness” (Romans 1:18). Paul’s accusers did not want to hear the message of salvation, so they imprisoned and eventually killed the messenger. Jesus warned us that we should not be surprised when the world hates Christians because it hated Him first (John 15:18; 1 John 3:13). May we all embrace suffering for Christ with the grace and humility that the apostle Paul showed.', 'source': 'https://www.gotquestions.org/why-was-Paul-in-prison.html'}, {'category': 'Questions about False Beliefs', 'sub.category': 'False Beliefs about the Bible', 'question': 'What is the gospel of Paul?', 'answer': \"Answer\\nOther than our Lord Jesus, Paul is probably the most prominent character in the New Testament. Born in Tarsus shortly after the birth of Jesus, Paul, then known as Saul, was a Benjamite brought up in the strict manner of the Pharisees. Early in life, he demonstrated a keen intellect and a zeal for the traditions of Judaism. Though afforded the rights of a Roman citizen, Paul was an ardent Jewish nationalist who despised the ways of the Gentiles. Prior to his dramatic conversion during a journey to Damascus, Saul was a fiery persecutor of the church. After his conversion, he became the New Testament’s most prolific writer and Christianity’s most tireless missionary.\\nPaul speaks of the message he proclaimed as “my gospel” in Romans 2:16 and 16:25. What, then, is the “gospel of Paul”? Does it differ from the true gospel, the gospel the other apostles preached? Or does he call it “my gospel” for a different reason?\\nDuring his long ministry, Paul’s apostolic authority was repeatedly questioned (1 Corinthians 9:2; 2 Corinthians 11) despite his acceptance by the church (Acts 9:19–25; Galatians 1:18–20). Even today, there are cultic groups that deny the legitimacy of Paul’s ministry. Those who question Paul’s apostolic authority ignore the testimony of Peter, James, and John, recognized apostles of Christ and pillars of the early church, who extended “the right hand of fellowship” to Paul and his companion Barnabas (Galatians 2:9). Let us set aside any foolish belief that Paul was a counterfeit apostle who preached a spurious message, for the plain teachings of Scripture proves otherwise.\\nThe gospel of Paul was not a different or a counterfeit gospel; the “good news” or “good announcement” he preached conformed in every way to the teachings of the Old Testament writers, the other apostles of the faith, and, most importantly, to the gospel message according to Jesus Christ. If there is a difference in the apostle Paul’s treatment of the gospel, it is not in the essence of the message but in the meticulous detail of the gospel. Indeed, most notably in Romans and Galatians, the apostle Paul, guided by the Holy Spirit, delves into the lofty heights and unfathomable depths of the gospel unlike any other New Testament writer. Even Peter, the Apostle to the Jews, was moved by the “weightiness” of Paul’s writings (2 Peter 3:15–18).\\nWith that said, let us explore the question “What is the gospel of Paul?”\\nWhose gospel is this?\\nPaul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ. (Romans 1:1–6, ESV)\\nIs this Paul’s gospel? By his own words,\\n\\n• the message he preached is the gospel of God (verse 1)\\n• the good news Paul preached, the gospel of God, was foretold by the holy prophets long before Paul lived (verse 2)\\n• the gospel message focuses on Christ Jesus, a descendant of King David according to the Scriptures (verse 3)\\n• though born of a woman and, thus, being fully man, Jesus was also fully God and divine in nature; His Sonship was indisputably established by the Holy Spirit through His bodily resurrection (verse 4)\\n• Paul’s authority as an apostle, being called to preach the gospel of God, was granted to him by none other than the Lord Jesus Christ (verse 5)\\n• those called of God, having heard and believed the gospel of God, now belong to the Lord Jesus (verse 6)\\nThe gospel focuses on the Lord Jesus (Romans 1:9) and His sacrificial death, burial, and resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:1–4). Paul unashamedly devoted himself to broadcasting this thrilling message, for the gospel reveals the power of God—a mighty force capable of transforming sinners into saints (Romans 1:16). Knowing we are incapable of saving ourselves, we trust the gospel, which reveals the righteousness of God, who saves all who simply believe (Romans 1:17).\\nNow, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born. (1 Corinthians 15:1–4, ESV)\\nAccording to this passage,\\n\\n• there is only one gospel: it is the gospel of God that Paul preached and in which the redeemed have taken their stand (verse 1)\\n• this is the gospel that saves, the gospel Paul delivered, and the gospel that must never be forgotten or discarded (verse 2)\\n• according to the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus died for our sins. His sacrifice paid our sin debt (verse 3)\\n• after His lifeless body was taken from the cross and laid to rest in a borrowed tomb, Jesus miraculously walked away from where He lay, as foretold by the holy prophets, proving His absolute power over sin and death (verse 4)\\nHow can this be? Dead men do not rise from their graves. A jeering mob had witnessed our Lord’s mangled body hanging lifeless on a cruel Roman cross. To counter those who would say the Lord’s bodily resurrection is no more than a fanciful tale, He appeared to His disciples and to a company of more than five hundred eyewitnesses. The resurrection did not take place in a dark, hidden corner; the evidence of Jesus’ bodily resurrection is a verifiable fact beyond dispute (1 Corinthians 15:5–8).\\nThe Gospel of Antiquity\\nThe gospel did not originate with Paul, nor did Paul preach a new or novel message that was hitherto unknown:\\nAnd if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you. (1 Peter 1:17–20, ESV, emphasis added)\\nIn His perfect knowledge, God knew, even before He spoke the earth into existence, that mankind would need a redeemer. It is rightfully said Christ was slain before the foundation of the world.\\nThe Lord God said to the serpent,\\n“Because you have done this,\\n cursed are you above all livestock\\n and above all beasts of the field;\\non your belly you shall go,\\nand dust you shall eat\\nall the days of your life.\\nI will put enmity between you and the woman,\\nand between your offspring and her offspring;\\nhe shall bruise your head,\\nand you shall bruise his heel.” (Genesis 3:14–15, ESV, emphasis added)\\nThe gospel was first preached by God in the Garden of Eden; the future Messiah, called the “Seed” of the woman (NKJV), would suffer an injury by the hand of Satan, but, in the end, our conquering Savior would deliver a fatal blow to our infernal enemy. As our Savior suffered on the cross, it appeared victory belonged to Satan, but the victory was short-lived. Jesus conquered death and, in doing so, set the stage for Satan’s ultimate doom (Revelation 20:10).\\nThe Jews answered him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge. Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.” The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet you say, ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.’ Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?” Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’ But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it and was glad.” (John 8:48–56, ESV, emphasis added).\\nHigh atop a mountain in the land of Moriah, Abraham told his son Isaac that God would provide the sacrificial lamb (Genesis 22:8). Though Abraham lived some two millennia before the Lord Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem, the patriarch was well familiar with the gospel message, and, in fulfillment of Abraham’s prophetic utterance, God indeed provided the perfect, unblemished sacrificial Lamb (John 1:29; 1 Peter 1:17–20; Revelation 5:8–10).\\nSurely he has borne our griefs\\n  and carried our sorrows;\\nyet we esteemed him stricken,\\n  smitten by God, and afflicted.\\nBut he was pierced for our transgressions;\\n  he was crushed for our iniquities;\\nupon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,\\n  and with his wounds we are healed.\\nAll we like sheep have gone astray;\\n  we have turned—every one—to his own way;\\nand the Lord has laid on him\\n  the iniquity of us all. (Isaiah 53:4–6, ESV)\\nEight hundred years before Roman guards nailed iron spikes into the hands and feet of our Lord Jesus, Isaiah peered into the future and foretold of the Messiah’s sacrificial death, which is foundational to the gospel. The gospel according to the prophet Isaiah is the same gospel preached by the apostle Paul, who wrote, “But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world” (Galatians 6:14, ESV).\\nThe New Testament Gospel\\nPulling back the curtain of time, the Holy Spirit allowed the prophets and patriarchs of old to see the future coming of the Messiah; then, in the fullness of time, the Son of God clothed Himself in human flesh to fulfill His role as Redeemer (John 1:14; Luke 19:10).\\nThe next day [John] saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.’” (John 1:29–30, ESV)\\nJohn the Baptist testified that Jesus was the long-awaited sacrificial Lamb sent by God according to the words of the holy prophets. To fulfill this role, Jesus had to be sinless and willing to die for the sin of the world. Had Jesus been born with a sin nature, there would be no gospel message.\\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. (John 3:16–18, ESV)\\nThis most familiar passage gives us the essence of the gospel. God sent His Son, the One who shared in His divine nature, to save a lost world. Those who receive Him by faith are granted everlasting life. Conversely, those who reject Him are already condemned. Later, the apostle Paul wrote, “But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast” (Ephesians 2:4–9, ESV). It is obvious the message of Paul agrees with the gospel according to Jesus.\\nPeter preached on the Day of Pentecost,\\n“Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,\\n  ‘The Lord said to my Lord,\\n  “Sit at my right hand,\\n  until I make your enemies your footstool.”’\\nLet all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”\\nNow when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” (Acts 2:29–38, ESV)\\nFrom Peter’s powerful sermon, we learn\\n\\n• Christ Jesus was a descendant of King David (verse 30)\\n• Christ Jesus was raised from the dead (verse 31)\\n• Peter and many others were eye-witnesses of our Lord’s bodily resurrection (verse 32)\\n• now that Jesus sits at the right hand of the Father, the Holy Spirit of God begins His ministry (verse 33)\\n• God the Father promises God the Son that His enemies will be defeated (verses 34–35)\\n• the One crucified is both Lord and Christ (verse 36)\\nConvicted by the Holy Spirit, Peter’s audience asked what they were to do. By faith, they believed Peter’s gospel message, so what was next? Peter instructed his audience to repent, that is, to renounce the rites and rituals of mere religion by turning to the living Savior. Repentance involves a change of heart and a change in direction. Peter also instructed the new believers to publicly acknowledge their newfound faith through water baptism. Believers are not saved by the ordinance of baptism, but believers willingly choose to be baptized because they have been saved.\\nAgain, the gospel focuses on the person of Jesus and His death, burial, and resurrection. Jesus is the unique, unblemished, and uncompromised Anointed One, fully God and fully man, who overcame death and the grave so that all who believe in Him will receive the gift of everlasting life. This is in accordance with the inspired teachings of both the Old and New Testament writers.\\nWarning against counterfeit gospel messages\\nJust as our Lord Jesus warned against false christs (Matthew 24:23–24), the apostle Paul warned against perversions of the gospel. Satan understands that false christs and false gospel messages are incapable of saving lost sinners, so for two thousand years, our enemy has been counterfeiting phony messiahs and advancing spurious gospel messages.\\nI am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. (Galatians 1:6–9, ESV)\\nPaul’s warning to the church in Galatia says\\n\\n• those who follow a different gospel have, in truth, deserted our Lord Jesus and have turned their backs on His loving grace (verse 6)\\n• there is only one gospel, and all others are worthless distortions of the truth (verse 7)\\n• those who preach counterfeit gospel messages are heretics worthy of damnation (verses 8–9)\\nObviously, those who proclaim there are many ways to God are the false teachers Paul warned against.\\nConclusion\\nDespite the false charges levied against Paul, his gospel teachings are in harmony with the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets, his New Testament contemporaries, and, most importantly, the teachings of Jesus. Those who accuse Paul of having strayed from the gospel stand on shaky ground; Scripture proves that, rather than teaching a “different gospel,” he gave the church greater insight into the only true gospel, the gospel of God (Romans 1:1). The following passage gives ample evidence that Paul’s prime motive was not in making a name for himself, but in furthering the cause of Christ:\\nI appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment. For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers. What I mean is that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.” Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name. (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.) For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. (1 Corinthians 1:10–17, ESV)\\nWhat is the gospel of Paul? Quite simply, the gospel Paul preached is the same gospel proclaimed by the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and the Lord Jesus. The gospel of Paul is the gospel of God. He refers to it as “my gospel” because it was the message he had devoted his life to proclaiming.\", 'source': 'https://www.gotquestions.org/gospel-of-Paul.html'}, {'category': 'Questions about the Bible', 'sub.category': 'Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha', 'question': 'What is the Apocalypse of Paul?', 'answer': 'Answer\\nThe Apocalypse of Paul, or the Revelation of Paul, is a non-canonical book, purportedly written by the apostle Paul, that describes, in graphic detail, life in heaven and hell. It supposedly relates what Paul witnessed when he was caught up to the third heaven (see 2 Corinthians 12).\\nAs the story goes, Paul wrote his revelation but was ordered to hide the manuscript beneath the foundation of a house situated in Tarsus. Tarsus was the apostle Paul’s place of birth. According to the legend, centuries after Paul’s death, an angel revealed the whereabouts of this hidden book, and, at long last, its contents were made public.\\nAmong the many theological oddities in the Apocalypse of Paul, damned souls suffering in hell are given a day of rest each Sunday (§ 44), an angel in hell with “a great fiery razor” cuts the lips and tongues of hypocrites (§ 37), and those who did not fast properly are tortured with great thirst while “hanging over a channel of water . . . and many fruits were placed in their sight, and they were not permitted to take of them” (§ 39). For a time, the book was popular among monks, for, according to its fanciful contents, those who endured the rigors of monastic life with its hard work and spartan conditions receive greater heavenly rewards.\\nAs to its authenticity, the Apocalypse of Paul (Latin, Visio Pauli) was unknown to the early church fathers; the manuscript was likely penned between AD 250—400, long after the canon of Scripture was closed. Augustine of Hippo labeled the writing as fraudulent (http://earlychristianwritings.com/apocalypsepaul.html, accessed 12/7/22). Scholars tend to believe the manuscript, which was condemned in the Decretum Gelasianum, a late fifth-century document reflecting the beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church, originated in an Egyptian monastery.\\nThe apostle Paul did experience a brief time to heaven. Referring to himself in the third person, perhaps as an indication of personal modesty, he wrote this:\\n\\n“I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. And I know that this man was caught up into paradise—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows—and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.” (2 Corinthians 12:2–4, ESV)\\nThe event described by Paul may have occurred when he was viciously attacked by a hostile mob in Lystra (Acts 14:19). Regardless, whether in the body or in spirit, the apostle was supernaturally transported to the “third heaven.” The third heaven refers to the place where God dwells. As to what the apostle saw and heard there, we do not know, for he was forbidden to share the details of this singular experience. We may assume the place where God dwells is indescribably glorious and far beyond the confines of human imagination. Paul, who had witnessed what awaits God’s people, seemed to have no fear of death (Philippians 1:21–23). He knew what awaited him in glory.\\nFrom time to time, someone outrageously claims to have visited heaven (or hell) and returned to earth. Such reports are good for television appearances and book sales, but the discerning Christian must surely ask, “If the apostle Paul was not permitted to tell of his heavenly journey, why would God allow this person to speak of such an experience?”\\nGod has told us all we need to know about heaven in the pages of Scripture. Spurious writings, such as the Apocalypse of Paul or a bestselling book touted by modern marketers, serve only to cloud our understanding.', 'source': 'https://www.gotquestions.org/apocalypse-of-Paul.html'}, {'category': 'Questions about Salvation', 'sub.category': 'Who can be Saved', 'question': 'Who can be saved?', 'answer': 'Answer\\nJesus clearly taught in John 3:16 that He will save anyone who believes in Him: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” This “whoever” includes you and every other person in the world.\\n\\nThe Bible says that, if salvation were based on our own efforts, no one could be saved: “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). Psalm 143:2 adds, “No one living is righteous before you.” Romans 3:10 affirms, “There is no one righteous, not even one.”\\nWe cannot save ourselves. Instead, we are saved when we believe in Jesus Christ. Ephesians 2:8–9 teaches, “It is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.” We are saved by God’s grace, and grace, by definition, cannot be earned. We do not deserve salvation; we simply receive it by faith.\\nGod’s grace is enough to cover all sin (Romans 5:20). The Bible is filled with examples of people who were saved from sinful backgrounds. The apostle Paul wrote to Christians who had formerly been living in a variety of sinful conditions, including sexual immorality, idolatry, adultery, homosexuality, thievery, greed, and drunkenness. But Paul tells them that, upon salvation, “You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God” (1 Corinthians 6:11).\\nThe apostle Paul himself had been a persecutor of Christians, approving of the death of Stephen (Acts 8:1) and arresting Christians and throwing them into prison (Acts 8:3). He would later write, “Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst” (1 Timothy 1:13–15).\\nGod often chooses to save unlikely candidates to serve His purposes. He saved a thief on a cross with only minutes to live (Luke 23:42–43), a persecutor of the church (Paul), a fisherman who had denied Him (Peter), a Roman soldier and his family (Acts 10), a runaway slave (Onesimus in Philemon), and many others. There is no one beyond God’s ability to save (see Isaiah 50:2). We must respond in faith and receive His free gift of eternal life.\\nWho can be saved? One thing is for certain—you can, if you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior! If you are not certain you have accepted Jesus as your Savior, you can respond right now in prayer. Saying a prayer is simply a way of declaring to God that you are relying on Jesus Christ as your Savior. There are no magical words that result in salvation. It is only faith in Jesus’ death and resurrection that can save us. If you understand that you are a sinner and in need of salvation through Jesus Christ, here is a prayer you can pray to God:\\n“God, I realize I am a sinner and could never reach heaven by my own good deeds. Right now I place my faith in Jesus Christ as God’s Son who died for my sins and rose from the dead to give me eternal life. Please forgive me of my sins and help me to live for you. Thank you for accepting me and giving me eternal life.”\\nHave you, in faith, received Jesus Christ as your Savior because of what you have read here?

Blinded by the light, he was led to Damascus where Ananias restored his sight and he received the Holy Spirit. From then on, Saul, now called Paul, dedicated his life to spreading the gospel.  He embarked on missionary journeys, wrote many New Testament epistles, and ultimately died as a martyr in Rome.  His story demonstrates that anyone can be saved, become a powerful witness for Christ, and surrender fully to God.\\n'"
