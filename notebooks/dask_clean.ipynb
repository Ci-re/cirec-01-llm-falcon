will give you rest we have come to locate our most needed rest Lord in this empowerment Summit give rest from sickness rest from disease rest from every killer disease give rest in families give rest in businesses give your rest in ministries Lord give rest to Destiny through this empowerment Summit and with your divine presence Lord give each one here an encounter of a lifetime our eyes are looking unto you you are the reason we have come we have not come to see a man or a company of men we have come to see you Jesus manifest yourself to everyone Lord God manifest yourself to everyone Lord let your word have a free flow tonight let it deliver the desires of everyone into their hands and at the end of the day take all the glory in Jesus precious name let's give the Lord a big hand and take a seat now in this empowerment Summit I like us to first of all know what it takes to be empowered and then we get started something about God is that there is nothing is provided without telling us how to get across for every of his provision he has set conditions for us to actualize them so for you and I to be be empowered there is a fundamental requirement and when that fundamental requirement is made and we are set to go learning the technicalities of the process but first and foremost there must be that understanding of the fundamental condition for Supernatural empowerment and it's very simple oh Lord Ally will I seek thee my soul tested for thee and my flesh length for thee in a dry and T land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory even as I've seen thee in the sanctuary Psalm 63 and verse 1 to three oh Lord my God Al will I seek thee my soul tested for thee a genu thirst is a fundamental requirement for empowerment without a thirst you have no access a thirst is a fundamental requirement for Spiritual empowerment without a genu you have no assess oh Lord my God Al will I seek thee my soul tasted for thee and my flesh long for thee Oh Lord God in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory even as I've seen in the sanctuary it takes a genuine thirst to be genuinely empowered if you must be empowered if I must be empowered then a last is a requirement a fundamental requirement Jesus said in the last day of the great feast oh every man that tasted Come Ye to the waters Come Ye and drink of the Waters of Life freely and this spake of the holy spirit with them that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not received yet because Jesus was not yet glorified John 7:37 to oh every man that tasted Come Ye to the waters invitation is for the Thirsty oh every man that thirsted Come Ye to the waters John chapter 7 verse 37-39 and this spake he of the Holy Ghost this spake he of the mystery of empowerment oh every man that Ted Come Ye to the waters it's important therefore to generate the required this for empowerment that young lady in our testimony said I came and I said Lord I want to encounter you for a change that will not require me announcing it when Moses came back from you he didn't need to announce he was coming from you there was a change on his face and 4 days after she arrived back at work 4 days she was promoted and her salary doubled 4 days there was a desperation inside of her there was a thirst inside of her which qualified her for an encounter and I may I say this one gen new encounter is worth much more than a lifetime time of efforts one genuine encounter is worth much more than a lifetime of efforts one genuine encounter is worth much more than a lifetime of efforts one genuine encounter is worth much more than a lifetime of efforts one genuine encounter is worth much more than a lifetime of sweat and struggles May everyone in this Summit have his own and her own lifetime encounter that will keep you on a struggle free path the remaining days of your life this is very important one genuine encounter it is always a this people can be too emotional it's time for us to become true true and genuine I crave your greatest challenge will always meet you at a corner where what you are worth as a person is the only way out Peter was making noise when others were around after they were all gone a young lady met him and said you are one of them he was defenseless his boldness was a result of the environment when he was cornered he was helpless your greatest challenge will be face to face with you so you need a personal deposit that is able to carry you through at a tight corner you need your own personal encounter that will answer for you when no one else is around can I hear your loud this is crucial this important people are no longer thirsty for the power of God that's why we have become helplessly helpless even after Jesus Tau them for three and a half years he said look boys I can't guarantee your accomplishment T ye in Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high the the principles are powerless without empowerment it is the power of God that empowers the principle to produce proofs the principles are powerless without empowerment it is the empowerment of the holy spirit that empowers the principles to produce proofs H we need that the charismatics have come down cerebra M only the principles and we celebrate the principles and we become helpless when confronted by challenges Jesus said and you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you then you'll be qualified to stand for me otherwise you'll be swallowed up for I send you forth as Lambs Among Wolves you need to carry what the Wolves cannot destroy or otherwise they will eat you up this important Christ is made for us the power of God and the wisdom of God so it takes a combination of the power and the wisdom for our Dominion to be established the power and the wisdom the power and the wisdom the power and the wisdom the power and the wisdom 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 24 Jesus is made unto us the power of God and the wisdom of God so it's a combination of the power and the wisdom that establishes Destiny we need the power so there must be a desperation in our soul in order for us to qualify for a genuine encounter with the power of God genuine encounter with the power of God Isaiah 41 and verse 17 when the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue faith for thirst I the Lord will hear them I the god of Israel will not forsake them and what will I do I will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of The Valleys I will make the Wilderness a pool of water and the dry lands Springs of water I will plant in the wilderness the cedar the sheet tree and the Mattel and all the trees and I will set in the desert the far tree the pie and the Box tree together that they may see and know and consider and understand together that the hand of the Lord has done this and the Holy One of Israel has created it that's when the poor and the needy SE sick water and there is none and their soul fainted for thirst then I the Lord will hear from Heaven I will open up rivers in high places I will pour out my spirit upon them when their soul filth for last when their last is established I will be committed to empower until their last is established I'm not committed to empower them a t a last Isaiah 44 and very three and four for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty on whom will he pour his water the anointing of the holy spirit is poured only upon the thirsty is poured upon the Thirsty Isaiah 44: 3 and 4 for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon The Offspring and they shall spring up that means they have been kept down but when I pour my spirit they shall spring up they were up in the upper room all of them in hiding they were in hiding for shame and reproach and then the Holy Ghost came and the whole city gathered together to hear them and they took over the entire region under four weeks the whole Jerusalem was under siege priesthood lost their place to a few ignorant and unhanded men when the power of God came they sprang up it's time for you to spring up it's time for your health your health to Spring forth It's time for your destiny to spring up now this is very crucial this is very vital for I will pour water upon him that is this him and floats upon the dry ground no matter how dry your life may be spiritually with a genu thirst God said he will pour water he will pour you he will send this flood upon the dry places and then your Destinies will spring up now listen to this this is why the church has become so powerless we have mistaken the principles as a substitute for the power so we are saying it but we are not saying it we are saying what is written but nothing is happening to March it is written it is written yet it's not happening and yet we are not careful it is written it is written but it's not happening look I can't drink water for you everyone that requires a refreshing must be willing to drink the water by himself even though your wife and you are one flesh if you are thirsty your wife can't drink water on your behalf you can't say I'm busy drink water for me so nobody can be empowered for you nobody can be empowered for you nobody can be empowered for you now listen there is a dimension of empowerment that makes you absolutely i moved to every sickness and disease that is your body enjoys a Divine immunity malaria parasite dies as it enters his virus dissolves as it enters because of the power that you carry I tell you something that's why there is need for a desperation a desperation there is need for a desperation we have over celebrated principles and the kingdom of God is not in works but in power it is time to recapture the power of the kingdom it is time to recapture the power of the kingdom it is time to recapture the power of the kingdom it is time to recapture the power of the Kingdom this is very crucial that is the fundamental requirement you need to know that it takes a thirst to qualify for his power his power answers to the genu this of Man Without a genu this you are not a candidate for his power I think it's also important for me to help activate your this to see how helpless you and I are without his power too many people have a vision they know as it what God wants them to do yet they utterly helpless in doing it they saw a great vision all of gold like Zechariah Chapter 4 what see us die he said I see a Candlestick with seven lamps on it all of gold golden Vision delivered from Heaven genuine and correct yet will not see the light of the day and he say hey this is the word of the Lord to Z not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord this great vision you have seen is impossible without the empowerment of my spirit now what does that mean it means your mission on Earth is impossible without his power no matter how clear your vision no matter how Divine it is is it is impossible to fulfill it without empowerment Zechariah i 6-10 it takes his power to fulfill your mission on Earth so why must I be thirsty for his power because it takes his power to fulfill your mission on Earth your mission on Earth will remain an eternal impossibility without his empowerment why for by strength shall no man Prevail 1 Samuel 2:9 Why without me you can do nothing without me you can do nothing why the Bible says Romans chapter 9:1 16 it is not of him that will nor of him that run but of God that showed Mercy so you can't make it without him I can't make it without him he called them yet he said hey you can't fulfill your calling until you in deal with power from on high your calling will be lost until you are in power from on high and you know life without fulfillment is a burden life without fulfillment is a burden and that burden can only be lifted by the power of God at work in your life there are many people with great Visions which will never see the light of day because they don't know how to power their Vision into fulfillment no matter how costly and precious your car it requires foil to move even if you bought it $100,000 US you still have to foil it before it moves if you bought it $500,000 you still have to fix it before it moves so no matter how precious your vision without his unction you don't have motion it takes his function to give motion and an accomplishment to your vision so the holy spirit is the oil of Destiny without it you are surrounded without it you are a weight can you imagine having to push your caring you have some people working for you in the home your Gat men your security and they have to push your car to anywhere you are going so your car becomes a home your Gat men your security and they have to push your car to anywhere you are going so your car becomes a weight both to you and to the people that are with you and they will leave you one after the other well if the car will not start it's air condition will never work that means you'll be under the heat they'll be pushing you and be sing you perhaps what kind of man is this because he doesn't know it takes foil for his vehicle to move I'm glad to let you know tonight that if Jesus could not guarantee their accomplishment the accomplishment of their Divine Mission without this empowerment then I can't guarantee yours he can guarantee mine without his empowerment why must I be empowered my mission on Earth will remain impossible without his empowerment my vision will die with me without his empowerment my vision may never see the light of day without empowerment that's why tonight I believe that with a genu last every dead Destiny every dying Destiny every sleepy Vision will come back again it takes that why do I need to be empowered now listen every child of God is a child of Destiny the people he has predestinated Romans 829 and 30 he has called the people he has called he has Justified and the people he has Justified he has glorified so every one child of God has a glorious Destiny come and say glorious Destiny go every child of God has a glorious Destiny every every when Jesus came to the world the pro the Angels announced he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord shall give unto him the Throne of his father David Luke 1:31 that he shall be great and as the father sent him so as he sent you so as he sent me so you are also sent to be great can I hear your now now listen to this he has redeemed us unto our God Revelation 510 as priests and kings and we shall reign on the Earth what does that mean there is a throne for each of us on Earth that means every child of God that has been redeemed has been redeemed to rain not to be ruined so you are a royal priesthood you are an holy nation you are a peculiar people the Bible said he has brought you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light to show forth the Praises of him so your life is to show forth the Praises of God you are not to be pied by any man according to Redemption you are to be envied by every man now that's how precious your destiny is that's our precious of Destiny but why are we not realizing this glorious Destiny 1 Peter chapter 2:9 he said here peculiar people you are a royal priesthood you are an holy nation you have been chosen to show for face of him who has called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light that means you and I are destined to live the marvelous life the life that everybody in the world must Marvel at because light is equal to life in scriptures in him is life and that life is the light of men and that light shines in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not so every time you see light you see life so to live the marvelous life into His Marvelous Light means you are supposed to live a marvelous life listen whatever has tampered with your marvelous Destiny in Christ must give way to you tonight how is it that we have such a great Destiny and we still live such a miserable life most Believers are still living such a miserable life people are sting many of us instead of envying us they pity our health they pity our strength they pity our career they pity our ministry why Acts chapter 16 and verse 9 a great door and effectual is opened unto me but there are many adversaries for a great door so every child of God has a great door an effectual open unto him but there are many adversaries who say no way we won't let it happen that's why you need the power of God power is the only language that the enemy respects power is the only language that the enemy respects power is the only language that the enemy respects the enemy has no respect for grammar the enemy has no respect for eloquence the enemy has no respect for oration power is the only language that the enemy respects Psalm 66 and verse two how terrible art thou oh Lord in thy Works through the greatness of thy power shall thy enemies submit themselves unto you even God can get the enemies to submit without a demonstration of his great power so for your enemies and my enemies to submit to us we must be adequately empowered to match the dimension of opposition can I hear your loud here this we are Africans just last Sunday down in Lagos a big bed big bed was h in for my Master's bedroom and fell down dead did you understand what I'm saying a big bed black ugly there was no way such beds could have entered a place that was locked all windows shut but this evil bed still entered and was heading towards my bedroom and at the door of the the door that was being to my upper City room in the upstairs where my bedroom was where my wife bedroom was the board fell down dead fell down dead whatever is Mission was crash at that door I was not there but whatever you carry is resident where you live that's why you don't find Wonder around the Lion's Den whether the lion was at home or not because while you are still wondering the lion may arrive did you understand what I'm talking about what will happen to you in this Summit every devil will begin to clear off your environment that's the reason why many of us are not experiencing the marvelous life that you have been destined to enjoy because there are many adversaries there are many enemies who have vowed that we will never go who said no way we won't let you go but this is what the Bible says behold I have reserved power for you to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the powers of the enemy and nothing shall by enemies hurt you and nothing shall by enemies hurt you and nothing shall by enemies hurt you so it takes power to subdue the adversaries that have been are against your destiny it takes power one to fulfill your mission you need power to keep the enemies where they belong you need power so without power life becomes a burden that means his power is what gives meaning to our lives his power is what guarantees our fulfillment on Earth without his empowerment we are utterly helpless I'm praying tonight that your last will be beyond measure that this Summit will not be over without a you you been launched into a new dimension of power in your life it's very important so you need his power I need his power or our destiny will remain stranded or our mission on Earth will remain frustrated or we remain cheap victims of the wicked one we know that we of God but we also know that the whole world lies in wickedness 1 John chapter i 18 and 19 we know that we of God but we also know that the whole world come and say the whole world yes all nations of the Earth all cities in every nation the whole world lith in wickedness we know that we have God but we also know that the whole world Li in wickedness Psalm 74: 20 he said have respect to the Covenant oh God for the dark places of the earth they are full of the habitations of Cruelty have respect oh Lord to the Covenant for the dark places of the earth they are full of the habitations of quality what is the Covenant if you must subdue your enemy then get empowered if you must subdue your enemy then get empowered that means go for the power and then God is committed to keep your enemies under your feet until you are empowered God is not committed and until you are thirsty you cannot be empowered so get thirsty and go for the power and when you are empowered God is committed to keep your enemies under your feet there was a time down in Nigeria in our old church facility some fellows came together and said look we must kill this man what is he up to why is he making this much of noise why are they in this environment and they two cancer together we must kill him and I never knew nothing you know it's what you know you fight what you don't know you can't fight it I didn't know anybody was planning any evil I was still waving to them when I was driving but they had taken cancer together that they must kill him that's how vulnerable our Destinies are in the hands of the wicked that's how vulnerable we are they say we must kill him we must kill him and they gather together three of them and said this man must die and this man never knew whatever they were doing was just going up and down doing his business going to office and closing very late in the night they say kill him the man who cheered the meeting two days after the council were concluded his first son cried headache headache fell down and died 42 years old while they were crying over that two days after the second son hey hey fell down and died meting scattered meting scattered he says surely they shall gather together but not by me and everyone that gathers together against you they shall fall for your sake they shall fall for your sake they shall fall for your sake at such times when you are fighting Invisible War it is the power you carry that fights for you he said when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of God shall raise up a standard against him Isaiah 59: 19 the spirit of God that you carry will rise in your place to fight The Invisible War the spirit of God on your life will rise in your stay to fight for you he said when the enemy shall come in like a flood you can't see them but they're there he said the spirit of the Lord that you carry will come out and begin to fight in your favor that's why you need to be empowered you can fight the one you see but oh god look this one must not be what of the ones who don't see and there are many more that you never see than the ones who see for we rescue not against flesh and blood we don't rescue against what we can see but against principalities against Powers against rulers of this wicked world and wicked Spirits in high places we are not wrestling against the tangible we are wrestling against the intangible the Invincible the one you cannot see that's why you need to be empowered I hope somebody is getting what I'm talking about even though God has called you into that business you may not make any meaningful mark because of the adversities that are fighting and your utter helplessness because you are not empowered it is the anointing on you that fights the war that you cannot see hey is somebody hearing what I'm talking about that's important there was a time in the in the Ministry of John G Lake during the a time of epidemic just like we are having his a now there was this bubonic kind of attack in those days in South Africa and this man carries such power anybody that contacted the form in the mouth of The Afflicted caught the disease he was using his hand to wipe off the foam and when they tested the foam on John G L's hand the viruses were found dead in it because of the power the enormity of the power at work in John G L friends it's time to look for it it's time to look for it it's time to look for it's time to be desperate for his power the kingdom of God is not in work but in power it's time to go for the power it's time to go for the powerful it's time to go for the power many many years ago in those days when our church first began some forces came into town because one of them eventually got saved the last story I was sharing it was one of them who ran for rescue one of the three and told all the stories of what happened that other one who was to sponsor The Killing process lost his business he became a pop ended up spending 5 years in prison and had to come back to my own office to beg for money the same person who was to sponsor my killing did you understand what I'm talking about the third person ran away just disappeared his wife left his children left his Destiny turned upside down now all those wars were fought on my behalf by the operation of the spirit of God that's why I know whatever has been said to keep you down must give way to you here must give way to you here it must give way to you here can I hear your loud and believing it takes the power of God for your destiny to be fulfilled on Earth it takes the power of God for your enemies to be kept under your feet it takes the power of God for your life to be meaningful it takes the power of God that's why we must look for the power of God we must look for the power of God we must seek the power of God with a desperation in our heart it takes that many years ago some forces came into the city where we were and they came according to them to attack churches one of them got saved and came into the Full Gospel and shared the testimony they came to attack churches they set confusions set turbo in various congregations whichever way they found the way of doing that but they did but when they came to our only little church they couldn't break into that place because according to him there was a thick canopy of thorns that was sitting over that little assembly and they said okay now that we can't get there can we get a demand so they started hunting for me in the realm of the spirit and he said they kept haunting for me and hunting for me but they couldn't find me because I was far up in the sky far up in the sky and that man got convicted by the Holy Spirit he left that cult and came to the Full Gospel and gave his life to Christ and shared the testimony in the open look he says Simon Simon Satan desires to have you he wants to kill you he wants to set you like we but I've prayed for you that thy faith eth not the thief is still looking for who to kill he's still looking for who to destroy that's why we can't assume that everything is okay we must be robbed with power to keep him under our feet can I hear your loud whatever forces will let that church grow I ca it tonight in the name of Jesus whatever forces won't let your family enjoy peace I ca them in the name of Jesus whatever is frustrating your business and career I command them destroyed in the name of Jesus this important it takes the power of God to fulfill our destiny on Earth it takes the power of God to fulfill our destiny on Earth and it takes a desperation to qualify for that empowerment for he will pour his water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground and then they shall begin to Spring forth they shall begin to Spring forth they shall begin to Spring forth they be breaking forth they be breaking through to the right breaking through to the left and going up it is my prayer that tonight that same power will answer for you 120 people were empowered in the upper room and the whole earth erupted it is my prayer that as we are concluding this meeting this weekend something unusual will break forth in Kenya the little one among us when you look at anyone carrying his his will dissolve you look at anyone carrying cancer cancer will disappear something is about busting forth I can sense that in my spirit I knew that this is not an ordinary meeting this is not what I prepared for to do this is not the area I was coming into before but God spoke to me he said the principles are no substitutes for my power tell them the principles are powerless without my power tell them the principles will never produce proofs without my power it is my power that gives value to the principles and that's why I'm saying this this afternoon this evening it's time for us to get back to the basics it's time to get back to the basics it's time to get back to the basics we must not be satisfied with acting scriptures we must be willing we must be desperate to prove scriptures come and say proof Pro yes we have been quoting scriptures enough let's start proving scriptures let's start proving scriptures and it takes the power of God to prove Scriptures it takes the power of God to prove Scriptures it takes the power of God to prove Scriptures it takes the power of God to prove scriptures can I hear your he said the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou my right hand Psalm 110 her 1-3 Psalm 110 her 1-3 the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thy enemies thy first to he said the Lord shall send the rod of his strength out of Zion rule thou in the midst of thy enemies thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power I'd like you to know we are right in the center of the day of his power and without his power you cannot rule in the midst of your enemies without his power you cannot rule in the midst of your enemies he takes his power for you and I to rule in the midst of our enemies I don't know if that to had gained access to my bedroom whatever its mission was maybe I will not be here today so your mission your destiny is at stake without his power so rule down in the midst of the enemies listen to this Jesus will not come until the church is practically ruling in the midst of our enemies so his will be subdued under our feet cancer will become a CH a mismate in the mouth of God's people when you say go it will go at your instance now this is very important he said sit down Jesus you are not going anywhere where until I make all your enemies th food St I'm going to use the CH to make it happen I will send forth the rod of my strength out of Zion I will cause Zion to rise up one more time and saviors will emerge from on Zion that's what God is saying that means we must be desperate to be a partaker of that day of his power which has started the day of his power has started the day of his power has started the day of his his power has started the day of his power has started the day of his power has started the day of his power is here and Jesus will not return until the day of his power is accomplished he will not return until the church is practically ruling in the midst of our enemies he will not return until the church is ruling in the midst of witches and wizards he will not return until the church is ruling over sickness and diseases so we have a job on our hand but the good news is the heavens are open the heavens are open the heavens are open the heavens are open let me tell you what happened many many Christians think is only pastors who need the power of God they think it's only ministers who need the power of God so they carry their plagues carry their afflictions permanently they keep seeking for help where there is no help you know what they said the five i virgins they said go to them that sell and buy for yourself so it will not be inadequate for both we and you we can't give you from what we have go and buy for yourself when it comes to power you need your own personal asset because in the day of struggle there may not be anybody around you in the day when evil we visit there may not be anyone around you so you need your own oil he said go to them that sell and buy for yourselves we cannot give you from our own oil L it be inadequate for both we and you go to them that sell and buy for yourself and the oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit go to them that buy that s and buy for yourself go and buy for yourself go and buy for yourself we are out here in the day of his power everyone that cries out with a gen task for his power tonight you are returning home a transformed person can I hear your loudest if you are there can I hear your loudest person if you are there let me hear your loudest if you are there that's what it takes however knowing who you are helps you in the in manifest is power you being equipped is one knowing your worth is another that's why in spiritual battles the first thing he said in Ephesians chapter 6:10 he said finally Brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and then put on the whole for of God that is the only time it becomes meaningful be strong in the Lord know who you are in God know what you are worth in God so when you are empowered you are able to demonstrate that power with the required confidence Israel was heavily guarded for battle but none could de glad then came tiny David all of them carry the weapons of war but none of them could go forward then came David who did not carry as much as they carry but knew how much he was worth in God he headed on for glad and brought down his head because he was strong in the Lord he said the Lord who gave me the lion on the beer he will give me this uncircumcised Philistine today you know those who know their God they shall be strong and they shall do exploits I want to point to you a few scriptural tips that will help energize your personal worth in Christ when that happens the anointing now has found a proper platform for manifestations when you come to know what he has made you then when his power comes on you you are no longer in the hiding you come to the open and say Satan show up here and I will show you the son of who I am can I hear your L who am I in Christ that is the secret of your strength for battle who am I in Christ Hi listen very carefully this a very sensitive hour very sensitive hour because whatever has had you down as you begin to come to the awareness of who you are I see the chains being broken there are individuals carrying his AIDS virus you are getting loosed at this moment here this The Book of Psalms 82 and verse i 7 they know not neither will they understand so they walk on in darkness I have said ye are gods and I mean all of you that are children of the most high God he said but he shall die like men and fall like one of the princes is said because they know not and neither do they understand all the foundations of the Earth are out of cause they lost absolute control they became vulnerable to so and circumstances because they do not know what I've said that they are Hey listen Psalm 82: 5-7 that's what I'm reading from they know not neither will they understand so they walk on in darkness and all the foundations of the Earth are out of cause I have said ye are gods and I mean all of you that are children of the most high God and they said but you don't know and you don't understand what you are and who you are he said You shall die like men and fall like one of the princes that's how important it is for you and I to know who we are in Christ we understand from Genesis that like beget like if you are a son of God that means whatever makes God God is in you can I hear your every human carries a mortal life only God carries eternal life is appointed unto man once to die so every Mortal man carries mortal life but when you accept Jesus as your lord and savior God so loved the world he G only whoever believes in him should not perish but have every everlasting life so our mortal life is exchanged for everlasting life at Salvation so our temporal life was exchanged for eternal life at Salvation so when you are saved you carry the same thing that makes God God inside you is somebody hearing what I'm saying said I have said ye are God say who are they the pastors the evangelists the Bishops the AR Bishops who are Gods the evangelists the apostles who are Gods he said all of you that are children of the most high God why you share the a common life with God you carry eternal life inside you so whatever molest mortal life cannot molest you because you carry eternal life inside you can can I hear your now listen the Bible says God is a spirit John chapter i 24 and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth say with me God is a spirit God is a spirit now in John 3:8 he said the wind blows where it listen you can't tell where it's coming from or where it's going he says so is everyone that is born of the spirit remember he said that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit is not spiritual is spirit so at New Birth you have become a reborn Spirit can I hear your that thing that died in you when Adam fell has come back to life and what was it that died in you your spirit man because after the fall Adam still had a soul he was still thinking he was still planning what to use to cover his nakedness he still had a body he was hiding but that vital link between Adam and God had been broken his Spirit you know God said the day you eat of it you shall surely die so it was the spirit of Adam that died so when you are born again it is that spirit that comes back to life so God is a spirit you are a spirit you are in the very same class with God he is somebody hearing what I'm talking about listen to this you don't carry a mortal life again mortal life is subjective to Corruptions mortal life can be perverted by his virus mortal life can be tormented by cancer but you now have eternal life could you imagine Jesus carrying answer could you imagine Jesus carrying his he said when you are confused as to the plan of God look onto Jesus is the author and the finisher of our faith look onto him whatever cannot be found in Christ that is in you I Cur them in the name of Jesus that's who you are you are a child of God you share a common life with God eternal life is what to carry not a mortal life eternal life is what to car not a temporal life that gives you worth that should give you a sense of worth it gives you the confidence required to confront oppositions shut up a child of the king is talking shut up he enough he enough shut up this is not permitted in the nature I carry now shut up he hears you that's who you are now listen to this listen very carefully the Bible says he has raised us up together with him Ephesians 2:5 and 6 and has made us to sit together with them in Heavenly places that is what happens at Redemption there is a change of your citizenry you are lifted from this Earthly realm spiritually into a Heavenly place with Christ that's what the word says now the question is what is the worth of your new status your new place your new citizenry Ephesians chapter 1:20 the Bible said Christ is seated in Heavenly places far above all principalities and powers and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come so the Heavenly places where you are seated is far above say with me far above far so you are spiritually seated far above the Realms where all principalities and powers and dominions can operate so where you are the devil cannot harass you can I hear your I said the enemy has no legal right to harass you where you are because you are seated far above him come and say far above far say loud and far above so where you are seated his a has no right to molest you where you are seated cancer has no right to humiliate you where you are seated death has no right to strike at you where you are seated is far above where they can function now you see that far above mentality will help your smartness in the demonstration of the power of God you are far above so when you are talking to the sick you are talking and praying for the sick with a far above mentality be healed in the name of Jesus be set free in the name of Jesus that's what happens he has raised you and me together with him and made us to sit together with him in Heavenly place far above all principalities and Powers far above far above far above you need a far above mentality as a child of God to keep your enemies under your feet you need a far above mentality as a child of God to keep your enemies under your feet you remember Paul the Apostle he was toying with death he said I don't know what to choose whether to go or to remain now you see to remain is more profitable for you but to go is profitable for me anyway the way you are looking I will stay now you see that is that is a man who was too confident of his position now listen the stone PA to death and they drag him out of the city and the people gathered together to plan his barrier that means they shook him he didn't shake they are spiritual people they would have prayed they opened his eye it was closed they opened his mouth it has gone together so they said well where do we bury him how do we go about it do we send for James do we stand for John how do we go about this why they were planning his barrier he stood up can you understand what I'm talking about that man was too much why because he knew his worth in Christ friends you are too far above what is tormenting you you must rise with anger tonight and say enough is enough enough is enough enough is enough enough is enough enough is enough Hallelujah is someone exited here tonight are you excited here tonight are you excited here tonight are you excited here tonight God is a spirit you are a spirit God is light isn't that in your Bible 1 John chapter 1 very he said God is light now God is light and he said ye are the light light of the world so you share that nature with him and that light shines in darkness and darkness cannot handle it so Darkness can molest you can I hear your Darkness cannot molest you Darkness cannot molest you Darkness cannot molest you before I close tonight please understand this the Bible say there was war in heaven Revelation 2 12: 7 Satan fought and his angels against Michael and prevailed not neither was there any more place found for him In Heaven There was war in heaven even though we're Heavenly places we can still experience War there was war in heaven but Satan prevailed not I'm glad to let you know where you are Satan has no power to Prevail you are seated together in Heavenly places Satan has no power to Prevail where you are now has he can be rude enough to fight but he has no right to Prevail he may be rude enough to fight but he has no right to Prevail he may be rude enough to attack you but he has no right to Prevail he said he prevailed not neither was there any place found for him in heaven he lost all the rounds he did not win any point there was no place f for him he had no marks every Mark of the devil on your life till this moment I command them blotted out forever in the name of Jesus Satan shall have no no no more mark on your destiny all the days of your life in the name of Jesus he said therefore wo unto the inhabitants of the Earth for Satan is come down unto you having great wrath because he knows know that he has but a short time but Rejoice ye heavens and all that doing so there are people dwelling in Heavens right here because the accuser of the bread has been cast down so listen in heaven where you live only joy and rejoicing is permitted therefore everything causing you sorrow I command them to come to an end tonight in the name of Jesus sorrow over your children I command them to come to an end tonight in the name of Jesus sorrow over your family I command them to come to an end tonight in the name of Jesus friends that's what it takes it takes a desperation with understanding to be r with the power of God in order to fill your destiny in a grand time and may I say this as I close the holy spirit is the principal channel of that empowerment is the principal channel of that empowerment but this is how he empowers you you want to know how he empowers you before we close tonight I'd like you to please listen to this this is how the Holy Ghost empowers you now if you look at Isaiah 11 and verse 1 to he said there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and the spirit of the Lord shall come upon him the spirit of wisdom of cancel of knowledge of the fear of the Lord of Might and shall make him of quick understanding here this God's people even though the Holy Ghost is our principle the principal channel of empowerment but he empowers Us principally by quickening our understanding in the truth and when the understanding of the truth is on you you are practically in command of the Affairs of life because he upholds all things by the word of his power how many things Hebrews 1:3 all things are at the command of the word of his power so the Holy Ghost empowers Us principally by opening our understanding into the truth and when you understand the truth you are in command of situations because when Jesus said it is written the correct one it is written rightly divided it is written then Satan need him and Angels Came and ministered unto him listen to this Paul said I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the carrier of the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes so God's power is embedded in his word and the Holy Ghost opens our understanding to assess that power so when the Holy Ghost comes on you he does not only make you carry any feeling you may not even carry no feeling but he strikes through scriptures to put in your hand what will give you the victory you require can I hear your loud when Jesus introduced the holy spirit this is what he said in John 14:26 he said when it's come he will teach you all things what will he do he will give you all kinds of feelings no he will teach you all things and it will bring to your remembrance all things as they are needed whatever you have heard from me all things so his mission is to open up our understanding into the things of God that will give us practical command of the issues of life he opens our understanding into the things of God that will give us practical command over the issues of life you have the appropriate it is written and when you come out with the appropriate scripture every devil bows up can I hear your loud because that light shines in darkness and darkness can't stop it no force in hell can stop the word of God from being effectual when the correct word is found every devil gives way when the correct word is found every devil gives away now in John 16 and verse 11-13 he said I have many things to say to you but you cannot handle them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself whatsoever shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come if you check all scriptures you find out the Holy Ghost principally opens the understanding of the Saints into the truth which gives the Saints command of the issues of Life can I hear your Amen in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:9 no man knows the things of a man but the spirit of man that is in him even so the things of God knower no man but by the spirit of God for the spirit of God ten all things say the Deep things of God the Deep things of God the Deep things of God so the Holy Ghost is our such light into the scriptures which puts us in command of the issues of Life can I hear your loud Every Act of God is a confirmation of his word so it takes a revelation of the word to commit God to confirm his word he takes a revelation of the word therefore listen to this listen very carefully Jesus has paid for your total health that means sickness is a Leger in your life he say you have been bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are the Lord Lord the price has been fully paid for your total H therefore Satan has no legal right to molest your body 1 Corinthians 6:20 now now that's a word from the Lord and that word is for someone here that your body is no longer permitted to be molested by the devil because God has fully paid the total price for your to head in Christ therefore every Mark of the devil on your body I ca them tonight in the name of Jesus everyone appointed to death by the deadly ravaging plague of his 8 I command your release tonight in the name of Jesus wherever the enemy is sitting in your home on your shoulders around your destiny and in your business I command him to take his leave now in the name of Jesus that's what happens the gospel is the power of God is the carrier of the power of God so when you assess the word the appropriate word the power of God is made manifest and Satan cannot say no I said Satan cannot say no I said Satan cannot say no I said Satan cannot say no I said Satan cannot say no somebody's going hope tonight with a spark of God's fire on his life you will sleep tonight the way you have never slept before God's power will lay to rest every struggle of your life that's what it takes so what are we doing with we are thirsty for the power of God we want to fulfill Destiny we want to subdue our enemies under our feet and we want to have the privilege of the appropriate scripture part time to deal with the issues confronting us and when that happens Dominion is established in a grand sty friends you have what it takes to fulfill Destiny if you will ever care for it you have all all it takes as we begin to draw to a close tonight i like to give an opportunity to people in this Great summit tonight because the greatest Miracle On Earth Is the miracle of Salvation that is your rescue from this wicked world the Bible says how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation may I say this before we close before I invite you to be prayed for after the fall of Man man was reduced to dust he said for dust Thou Art and unto dust shall thou return before the fall man was molded from the dust and he became a living Soul after the fall he was reduced to dust and remember Jesus the Lord said to Satan he said upon thy belly shall thou go the days of thy life and dust shall be thy food so from the fall Man became a slave of the devil that's why the Bible said the God of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not so he became the God of this world he had the legal right to do whatever he like with everyone that is unregenerate everyone that is unredeemed so before you are born again you are a is meat to the devil he does whatever he likes at any time he likes Redemption is your only authentic escape from that word of wickedness you can't be in the government of the wicked and have joy when the wicked Ru the people mourn when you are in his government you are depressed when you're under his government you sorrow when you're under his government you cannot be excited because the government of the wicked forbids excitement and joy he does whatever he lies with the children of this world but when you are saved you have escaped I know there are people here who need to run for an escape tonight wherever you are you want to be born again you want to be become a child of God this is one grand opportunity for you until you are born again you are not entitled to his empowerment salvation is the great qualification for his empowerment wherever you are before I pray for people tonight i like you to stand to your feet you want to be born again tonight you want to be saved you want to become a child of God please stand to your feet wherever you are and I will pray with you Jesus said except you are born again you cannot see the kingdom of God you cannot see the kingdom of God except you are born again you cannot see the kingdom of God the power of God is real everyone in front please bow your heads as I lead you in prayer and pray this prayer of faith after me say with me Lord Jesus say It L Lord Jesus I accept you tonight as my Lord and my savior I believe you died for me on the third day you Rose again that I might be just if right now I believe I am forgiven I'm Justified I'm saved I'm born again I'm a Child of God thank you Lord for saving me I pray for you now Heavenly Father Your Grace has brought these precious people let the same Grace preserve them Lord keep them Lord until the end of the times in Jesus precious name all we have done tonight is to explore the secret of empowerment and I know inside me that Satan will no longer take you for a right from tonight whatever tree my heavenly father has not planted that is growing in your life I command them uprooted tonight in the name of Jesus whatever tree my heavenly father is not planted that is

       "  'corrected_transcript': \"shall we lift up our hands before the Lord Jesus we have come to you you are the one that invited us to come you said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest we have come to locate our most needed rest Lord in this empowerment Summit give rest from sickness rest from disease rest from every killer disease give rest in families give rest in businesses give your rest in ministries Lord give rest to Destiny through this empowerment Summit and with your divine presence Lord give each one here an encounter of a lifetime our eyes are looking unto you you are the reason we have come we have not come to see a man or a company of men we have come to see you Jesus manifest yourself to everyone Lord God manifest yourself to everyone Lord let your word have a free flow tonight let it deliver the desires of everyone into their hands and at the end of the day take all the glory in Jesus precious name let's give the Lord a big hand and take a seat now in this empowerment Summit I like us to first of all know what it takes to be empowered and then we get started something about God is that there is nothing is provided without telling us how to get across for every of his provision he has set conditions for us to actualize them so for you and I to be be empowered there is a fundamental requirement and when that fundamental requirement is made and we are set to go learning the technicalities of the process but first and foremost there must be that understanding of the fundamental condition for Supernatural empowerment and it's very simple oh Lord Ally will I seek thee my soul tested for thee and my flesh length for thee in a dry and T land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory even as I've seen thee in the sanctuary Psalm 63 and verse 1 to three oh Lord my God Al will I seek thee my soul tested for thee a genu thirst is a fundamental requirement for empowerment without a thirst you have no access a thirst is a fundamental requirement for Spiritual empowerment without a genu you have no assess oh Lord my God Al will I seek thee my soul tasted for thee and my flesh long for thee Oh Lord God in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory even as I've seen in the sanctuary it takes a genuine this to be genuinely empowered if you must be empowered if I must be empowered then a last is a requirement a fundamental requirement Jesus said in the last day of the great feast oh every man that tasted Come Ye to the waters Come Ye and drink of the Waters of Life freely and this spake of the holy spirit with them that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not received yet because Jesus was not yet glorified John 7:37 to oh every man that tasted Come Ye to the waters invitation is for the Thirsty oh every man that thirsted Come Ye to the waters John chapter 7 verse 37-39 and this spake he of the Holy Ghost this spake he of the mystery of empowerment oh every man that Ted Come Ye to the waters it's important therefore to generate the required this for empowerment that young lady in our testimony said I came and I said Lord I want to encounter you for a change that will not require me announcing it when Moses came back from you he didn't need to announce he was coming from you there was a change on his face and 4 days after she arrived back at work 4 days she was promoted and her salary doubled 4 days there was a desperation inside of her there was a thirst inside of her which qualified her for an encounter and I may I say this one gen new encounter is worth much more than a lifetime time of efforts one genuine encounter is worth much more than a lifetime of efforts one genuine encounter is worth much more than a lifetime of efforts one genuine encounter is worth much more than a lifetime of efforts one genuine encounter is worth much more than a lifetime of sweat and struggles May everyone in this Summit have his own and her own lifetime encounter that will keep you on a struggle free path the remaining days of your life this is very important one genuine encounter it is always a this people can be too emotional it's time for us to become true true and genuine I crave your greatest challenge will always meet you at a corner where what you are worth as a person is the only way out Peter was making noise when others were around after they were all gone a young lady met him and said you are one of them he was defenseless his boldness was a result of the environment when he was cornered he was helpless your greatest challenge will be face to face with you so you need a personal deposit that is able to carry you through at a tight corner you need your own personal encounter that will answer for you when no one else is around can I hear your loud this is crucial this important people are no longer thirsty for the power of God that's why we have become helplessly helpless even after Jesus Tau them for three and a half years he said look boys I can't guarantee your accomplishment T ye in Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high the the principles are powerless without empowerment it is the power of God that empowers the principle to produce proofs the principles are powerless without empowerment it is the empowerment of the holy spirit that empowers the principles to produce proofs H we need that the charismatics have come down cerebra M only the principles and we celebrate the principles and we become helpless when confronted by challenges Jesus said and you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you then you'll be qualified to stand for me otherwise you'll be swallowed up for I send you forth as Lambs Among Wolves you need to carry what the Wolves cannot destroy or otherwise they will eat you up this important Christ is made for us the power of God and the wisdom of God so it takes a combination of the power and the wisdom for our Dominion to be established the power and the wisdom the power and the wisdom the power and the wisdom the power and the wisdom 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 24 Jesus is made unto us the power of God and the wisdom of God so it's a combination of the power and the wisdom that establishes Destiny we need the power so there must be a desperation in our soul in order for us to qualify for a genuine encounter with the power of God gen new encounter with the power of God Isaiah 41 and verse 17 when the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue faith for thirst I the Lord will hear them I the god of Israel will not forsake them and what will I do I will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of The Valleys I will make the Wilderness a pool of water and the dry lands Springs of water I will plant in the wilderness the cedar the sheet tree and the Mattel and all the trees and I will set in the desert the far tree the pie and the Box tree together that they may see and know and consider and understand together that the hand of the Lord has done this and the Holy One of Israel has created it that's when the poor and the needy SE sick water and there is none and their soul fainted for thirst then I the Lord will hear from Heaven I will open up rivers in high places I will pour out my spirit upon them when their soul filth for last when their last is established I will be committed to empower until their last is established I'm not committed to empower them a t a last Isaiah 44 and very three and four for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty on whom will he pour his water the anointing of the holy spirit is poured only upon the thirsty is poured upon the Thirsty Isaiah 44: 3 and 4 for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon The Offspring and they shall spring up that means they have been kept down but when I pour my spirit they shall spring up they were up in the upper room all of them in hiding they were in hiding for shame and reproach and then the Holy Ghost came and the whole city gathered together to hear them and they took over the entire region under four weeks the whole Jerusalem was under siege priesthood lost their place to a few ignorant and unhanded men when the power of God came they sprang up it's time for you to spring up it's time for your health your health to Spring forth It's time for your destiny to spring up now this is very crucial this is very vital for I will pour water upon him that is this him and floats upon the dry ground no matter how dry your life may be spiritually with a genu thirst God said he will pour water he will pour you he will send this flood upon the dry places and then your Destinies will spring up now listen to this this is why the church has become so powerless we have mistaken the principles as a substitute for the power so we are saying it but we are not saying it we are saying what is written but nothing is happening to March it is written it is written yet it's not happening and yet we are not careful it is written it is written but it's not happening look I can't drink water for you everyone that requires a refreshing must be willing to drink the water by himself even though your wife and you are one flesh if you are thirsty your wife can't drink water on your behalf you can't say I'm busy drink water for me so nobody can be empowered for you nobody can be empowered for you nobody can be empowered for you now listen there is a dimension of empowerment that makes you absolutely i moved to every sickness and disease that is your body enjoys a Divine immunity malaria parasite dies as it enters his virus dissolves as it enters because of the power that you carry I tell you something that's why there is need for a desperation a desperation there is need for a desperation we have over celebrated principles and the kingdom of God is not in works but in power it is time to recapture the power of the kingdom it is time to recapture the power of the kingdom it is time to recapture the power of the kingdom it is time to recapture the power of the Kingdom this is very crucial that is the fundamental requirement you need to know that it takes a thirst to qualify for his power his power answers to the genu this of Man Without a genu this you are not a candidate for his power I think it's also important for me to help activate your this to see how helpless you and I are without his power too many people have a vision they know as it what God wants them to do yet they utterly helpless in doing it they saw a great vision all of gold like Zechariah Chapter 4 what see us die he said I see a Candlestick with seven lamps on it all of gold golden Vision delivered from Heaven genuine and correct yet will not see the light of the day and he say hey this is the word of the Lord to Z not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord this great vision you have seen is impossible without the empowerment of my spirit now what does that mean it means your mission on Earth is impossible without his power no matter how clear your vision no matter how Divine it is is it is impossible to fulfill it without empowerment Zechariah i 6-10 it takes his power to fulfill your mission on Earth so why must I be thirsty for his power because it takes his power to fulfill your mission on Earth your mission on Earth will remain an eternal impossibility without his empowerment why for by strength shall no man Prevail 1 Samuel 2:9 Why without me you can do nothing without me you can do nothing why the Bible says Romans chapter 9:1 16 it is not of him that will nor of him that run but of God that showed Mercy so you can't make it without him I can't make it without him he called them yet he said hey you can't fulfill your calling until you in deal with power from on high your calling will be lost until you are in power from on high and you know life without fulfillment is a burden life without fulfillment is a burden and that burden can only be lifted by the power of God at work in your life there are many people with great Visions which will never see the light of day because they don't know how to power their Vision into fulfillment no matter how costly and precious your car it requires foil to move even if you bought it $100,000 US you still have to foil it before it moves if you bought it $500,000 you still have to fix it before it moves so no matter how precious your vision without his unction you don't have motion it takes his function to give motion and an accomplishment to your vision so the holy spirit is the oil of Destiny without it you are surrounded without it you are a weight can you imagine having to push your caring you have some people working for you in the home your Gat men your security and they have to push your car to anywhere you are going so your car becomes a home your Gat men your security and they have to push your car to anywhere you are going so your car becomes a weight both to you and to the people that are with you and they will leave you one after the other well if the car will not start it's air condition will never work that means you'll be under the heat they'll be pushing you and be sing you perhaps what kind of man is this because he doesn't know it takes foil for his vehicle to move I'm glad to let you know tonight that if Jesus could not guarantee their accomplishment the accomplishment of their Divine Mission without this empowerment then I can't guarantee yours he can guarantee mine without his empowerment why must I be empowered my mission on Earth will remain impossible without his empowerment my vision will die with me without his empowerment my vision may never see the light of day without empowerment that's why tonight I believe that with a genu last every dead Destiny every dying Destiny every sleepy Vision will come back again it takes that why do I need to be empowered now listen every child of God is a child of Destiny the people he has predestinated Romans 829 and 30 he has called the people he has called he has Justified and the people he has Justified he has glorified so every one child of God has a glorious Destiny come and say glorious Destiny go every child of God has a glorious Destiny every every when Jesus came to the world the pro the Angels announced he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord shall give unto him the Throne of his father David Luke 1:31 that he shall be great and as the father sent him so as he sent you so as he sent me so you are also sent to be great can I hear your now now listen to this he has redeemed us unto our God Revelation 510 as priests and kings and we shall reign on the Earth what does that mean there is a throne for each of us on Earth that means every child of God that has been redeemed has been redeemed to rain not to be ruined so you are a royal priesthood you are an holy nation you are a peculiar people the Bible said he has brought you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light to show forth the Praises of him so your life is to show forth the Praises of God you are not to be pied by any man according to Redemption you are to be envied by every man now that's how precious your destiny is that's our precious of Destiny but why are we not realizing this glorious Destiny 1 Peter chapter 2:9 he said here peculiar people you are a royal priesthood you are an holy nation you have been chosen to show for face of him who has called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light that means you and I are destined to live the marvelous life the life that everybody in the world must Marvel at because light is equal to life in scriptures in him is life and that life is the light of men and that light shines in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not so every time you see light you see life so to live the marvelous life into His Marvelous Light means you are supposed to live a marvelous life listen whatever has tampered with your marvelous Destiny in Christ must give way to you tonight how is it that we have such a great Destiny and we still live such a miserable life most Believers are still living such a miserable life people are sting many of us instead of envying us they pity our health they pity our strength they pity our career they pity our ministry why Acts chapter 16 and verse 9 a great door and effectual is opened unto me but there are many adversaries for a great door so every child of God has a great door an effectual open unto him but there are many adversaries who say no way we won't let it happen that's why you need the power of God power is the only language that the enemy respects power is the only language that the enemy respects power is the only language that the enemy respects the enemy has no respect for grammar the enemy has no respect for eloquence the enemy has no respect for oration power is the only language that the enemy respects Psalm 66 and verse two how terrible art thou oh Lord in thy Works through the greatness of thy power shall thy enemies submit themselves unto you even God can get the enemies to submit without a demonstration of his great power so for your enemies and my enemies to submit to us we must be adequately empowered to match the dimension of opposition can I hear your loud here this we are Africans just last Sunday down in Lagos a big bed big bed was h in for my Master's bedroom and fell down dead did you understand what I'm saying a big bed black ugly there was no way such beds could have entered a place that was locked all windows shut but this evil bed still entered and was heading towards my bedroom and at the door of the the door that was being to my upper City room in the upstairs where my bedroom was where my wife bedroom was the board fell down dead fell down dead whatever is Mission was crash at that door I was not there but whatever you carry is resident where you live that's why you don't find Wonder around the Lion's Den whether the lion was at home or not because while you are still wondering the lion may arrive did you understand what I'm talking about what will happen to you in this Summit every devil will begin to clear off your environment that's the reason why many of us are not experiencing the marvelous life that you have been destined to enjoy because there are many adversaries there are many enemies who have vowed that we will never go who said no way we won't let you go but this is what the Bible says behold I have reserved power for you to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the powers of the enemy and nothing shall by enemies hurt you and nothing shall by enemies hurt you and nothing shall by enemies hurt you so it takes power to subdue the adversaries that have been are against your destiny it takes power one to fulfill your mission you need power to keep the enemies where they belong you need power so without power life becomes a burden that means his power is what gives meaning to our lives his power is what guarantees our fulfillment on Earth without his empowerment we are utterly helpless I'm praying tonight that your last will be beyond measure that this Summit will not be over without a you you been launched into a new dimension of power in your life it's very important so you need his power I need his power or our destiny will remain stranded or our mission on Earth will remain frustrated or we remain cheap victims of the wicked one we know that we of God but we also know that the whole world lies in wickedness 1 John chapter i 18 and 19 we know that we of God but we also know that the whole world come and say the whole world yes all nations of the Earth all cities in every nation the whole world lith in wickedness we know that we have God but we also know that the whole world Li in wickedness Psalm 74: 20 he said have respect to the Covenant oh God for the dark places of the earth they are full of the habitations of Cruelty have respect oh Lord to the Covenant for the dark places of the earth they are full of the habitations of quality what is the Covenant if you must subdue your enemy then get empowered if you must subdue your enemy then get empowered that means go for the power and then God is committed to keep your enemies under your feet until you are empowered God is not committed and until you are thirsty you cannot be empowered so get thirsty and go for the power and when you are empowered God is committed to keep your enemies under your feet there was a time down in Nigeria in our old church facility some fellows came together and said look we must kill this man what is he up to why is he making this much of noise why are they in this environment and they two cancer together we must kill him and I never knew nothing you know it's what you know you fight what you don't know you can't fight it I didn't know anybody was planning any evil I was still waving to them when I was driving but they had taken cancer together that they must kill him that's how vulnerable our Destinies are in the hands of the wicked that's how vulnerable we are they say we must kill him we must kill him and they gather together three of them and said this man must die and this man never knew whatever they were doing was just going up and down doing his business going to office and closing very late in the night they say kill him the man who cheered the meeting two days after the council were concluded his first son cried headache headache fell down and died 42 years old while they were crying over that two days after the second son hey hey fell down and died meting scattered meting scattered he says surely they shall gather together but not by me and everyone that gathers together against you they shall fall for your sake they shall fall for your sake they shall fall for your sake at such times when you are fighting Invisible War it is the power you carry that fights for you he said when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of God shall raise up a standard against him Isaiah 59: 19 the spirit of God that you carry will rise in your place to fight The Invisible War the spirit of God on your life will rise in your stay to fight for you he said when the enemy shall come in like a flood you can't see them but they're there he said the spirit of the Lord that you carry will come out and begin to fight in your favor that's why you need to be empowered you can fight the one you see but oh god look this one must not be what of the ones who don't see and there are many more that you never see than the ones who see for we rescue not against flesh and blood we don't rescue against what we can see but against principalities against Powers against rulers of this wicked world and wicked Spirits in high places we are not wrestling against the tangible we are wrestling against the intangible the Invincible the one you cannot see that's why you need to be empowered I hope somebody is getting what I'm talking about even though God has called you into that business you may not make any meaningful mark because of the adversities that are fighting and your utter helplessness because you are not empowered it is the anointing on you that fights the war that you cannot see hey is somebody hearing what I'm talking about that's important there was a time in the in the Ministry of John G Lake during the a time of epidemic just like we are having his a now there was this bubonic kind of attack in those days in South Africa and this man carries such power anybody that contacted the form in the mouth of The Afflicted caught the disease he was using his hand to wipe off the foam and when they tested the foam on John G L's hand the viruses were found dead in it because of the power the enormity of the power at work in John G L friends it's time to look for it it's time to look for it it's time to look for it's time to be desperate for his power the kingdom of God is not in work but in power it's time to go for the power it's time to go for the powerful it's time to go for the power many many years ago in those days when our church first began some forces came into town because one of them eventually got saved the last story I was sharing it was one of them who ran for rescue one of the three and told all the stories of what happened that other one who was to sponsor The Killing process lost his business he became a pop ended up spending 5 years in prison and had to come back to my own office to beg for money the same person who was to sponsor my killing did you understand what I'm talking about the third person ran away just disappeared his wife left his children left his Destiny turned upside down now all those wars were fought on my behalf by the operation of the spirit of God that's why I know whatever has been said to keep you down must give way to you here must give way to you here it must give way to you here can I hear your loud and believing it takes the power of God for your destiny to be fulfilled on Earth it takes the power of God for your enemies to be kept under your feet it takes the power of God for your life to be meaningful it takes the power of God that's why we must look for the power of God we must look for the power of God we must seek the power of God with a desperation in our heart it takes that many years ago some forces came into the city where we were and they came according to them to attack churches one of them got saved and came into the Full Gospel and shared the testimony they came to attack churches they set confusions set turbo in various congregations whichever way they found the way of doing that but they did but when they came to our only little church they couldn't break into that place because according to him there was a thick canopy of thorns that was sitting over that little assembly and they said okay now that we can't get there can we get a demand so they started hunting for me in the realm of the spirit and he said they kept haunting for me and hunting for me but they couldn't find me because I was far up in the sky far up in the sky and that man got convicted by the Holy Spirit he left that cult and came to the Full Gospel and gave his life to Christ and shared the testimony in the open look he says Simon Simon Satan desires to have you he wants to kill you he wants to set you like we but I've prayed for you that thy faith eth not the thief is still looking for who to kill he's still looking for who to destroy that's why we can't assume that everything is okay we must be robbed with power to keep him under our feet can I hear your loud whatever forces will let that church grow I ca it tonight in the name of Jesus whatever forces won't let your family enjoy peace I ca them in the name of Jesus whatever is frustrating your business and career I command them destroyed in the name of Jesus this important it takes the power of God to fulfill our destiny on Earth it takes the power of God to fulfill our destiny on Earth and it takes a desperation to qualify for that empowerment for he will pour his water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground and then they shall begin to Spring forth they shall begin to Spring forth they shall begin to Spring forth they be breaking forth they be breaking through to the right breaking through to the left and going up it is my prayer that tonight that same power will answer for you 120 people were empowered in the upper room and the whole earth erupted it is my prayer that as we are concluding this meeting this weekend something unusual will break forth in Kenya the little one among us when you look at anyone carrying his his will dissolve you look at anyone carrying cancer cancer will disappear something is about busting forth I can sense that in my spirit I knew that this is not an ordinary meeting this is not what I prepared for to do this is not the area I was coming into before but God spoke to me he said the principles are no substitutes for my power tell them the principles are powerless without my power tell them the principles will never produce proofs without my power it is my power that gives value to the principles and that's why I'm saying this this afternoon this evening it's time for us to get back to the basics it's time to get back to the basics it's time to get back to the basics we must not be satisfied with acting scriptures we must be willing we must be desperate to prove scriptures come and say proof Pro yes we have been quoting scriptures enough let's start proving scriptures let's start proving scriptures and it takes the power of God to prove Scriptures it takes the power of God to prove Scriptures it takes the power of God to prove Scriptures it takes the power of God to prove scriptures can I hear your he said the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou my right hand Psalm 110 her 1-3 Psalm 110 her 1-3 the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thy enemies thy first to he said the Lord shall send the rod of his strength out of Zion rule thou in the midst of thy enemies thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power I'd like you to know we are right in the center of the day of his power and without his power you cannot rule in the midst of your enemies without his power you cannot rule in the midst of your enemies he takes his power for you and I to rule in the midst of our enemies I don't know if that to had gained access to my bedroom whatever its mission was maybe I will not be here today so your mission your destiny is at stake without his power so rule down in the midst of the enemies listen to this Jesus will not come until the church is practically ruling in the midst of our enemies so his will be subdued under our feet cancer will become a CH a mismate in the mouth of God's people when you say go it will go at your instance now this is very important he said sit down Jesus you are not going anywhere where until I make all your enemies th food St I'm going to use the CH to make it happen I will send forth the rod of my strength out of Zion I will cause Zion to rise up one more time and saviors will emerge from on Zion that's what God is saying that means we must be desperate to be a partaker of that day of his power which has started the day of his power has started the day of his power has started the day of his his power has started the day of his power has started the day of his power has started the day of his power is here and Jesus will not return until the day of his power is accomplished he will not return until the church is practically ruling in the midst of our enemies he will not return until the church is ruling in the midst of witches and wizards he will not return until the church is ruling over sickness and diseases so we have a job on our hand but the good news is the heavens are open the heavens are open the heavens are open the heavens are open let me tell you what happened many many Christians think is only pastors who need the power of God they think it's only ministers who need the power of God so they carry their plagues carry their afflictions permanently they keep seeking for help where there is no help you know what they said the five i virgins they said go to them that sell and buy for yourself so it will not be inadequate for both we and you we can't give you from what we have go and buy for yourself when it comes to power you need your own personal asset because in the day of struggle there may not be anybody around you in the day when evil we visit there may not be anyone around you so you need your own oil he said go to them that sell and buy for yourselves we cannot give you from our own oil L it be inadequate for both we and you go to them that sell and buy for yourself and the oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit go to them that buy that s and buy for yourself go and buy for yourself go and buy for yourself we are out here in the day of his power everyone that cries out with a gen task for his power tonight you are returning home a transformed person can I hear your loudest if you are there can I hear your loudest person if you are there let me hear your loudest if you are there that's what it takes however knowing who you are helps you in the in manifest is power you being equipped is one knowing your worth is another that's why in spiritual battles the first thing he said in Ephesians chapter 6:10 he said finally Brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and then put on the whole for of God that is the only time it becomes meaningful be strong in the Lord know who you are in God know what you are worth in God so when you are empowered you are able to demonstrate that power with the required confidence Israel was heavily guarded for battle but none could de glad then came tiny David all of them carry the weapons of war but none of them could go forward then came David who did not carry as much as they carry but knew how much he was worth in God he headed on for glad and brought down his head because he was strong in the Lord he said the Lord who gave me the lion on the beer he will give me this uncircumcised Philistine today you know those who know their God they shall be strong and they shall do exploits I want to point to you a few scriptural tips that will help energize your personal worth in Christ when that happens the anointing now has found a proper platform for manifestations when you come to know what he has made you then when his power comes on you you are no longer in the hiding you come to the open and say Satan show up here and I will show you the son of who I am can I hear your L who am I in Christ that is the secret of your strength for battle who am I in Christ Hi listen very carefully this a very sensitive hour very sensitive hour because whatever has had you down as you begin to come to the awareness of who you are I see the chains being broken there are individuals carrying his AIDS virus you are getting loosed at this moment here this The Book of Psalms 82 and verse i 7 they know not neither will they understand so they walk on in darkness I have said ye are gods and I mean all of you that are children of the most high God he said but he shall die like men and fall like one of the princes is said because they know not and neither do they understand all the foundations of the Earth are out of cause they lost absolute control they became vulnerable to so and circumstances because they do not know what I've said that they are Hey listen Psalm 82: 5-7 that's what I'm reading from they know not neither will they understand so they walk on in darkness and all the foundations of the Earth are out of cause I have said ye are gods and I mean all of you that are children of the most high God and they said but you don't know and you don't understand what you are and who you are he said You shall die like men and fall like one of the princes that's how important it is for you and I to know who we are in Christ we understand from Genesis that like beget like if you are a son of God that means whatever makes God God is in you can I hear your every human carries a mortal life only God carries eternal life is appointed unto man once to die so every Mortal man carries mortal life but when you accept Jesus as your lord and savior God so loved the world he G only whoever believes in him should not perish but have every everlasting life so our mortal life is exchanged for everlasting life at Salvation so our temporal life was exchanged for eternal life at Salvation so when you are saved you carry the same thing that makes God God inside you is somebody hearing what I'm saying said I have said ye are God say who are they the pastors the evangelists the Bishops the AR Bishops who are Gods the evangelists the apostles who are Gods he said all of you that are children of the most high God why you share the a common life with God you carry eternal life inside you so whatever molest mortal life cannot molest you because you carry eternal life inside you can can I hear your now listen the Bible says God is a spirit John chapter i 24 and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth say with me God is a spirit God is a spirit now in John 3:8 he said the wind blows where it listen you can't tell where it's coming from or where it's going he says so is everyone that is born of the spirit remember he said that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit is not spiritual is spirit so at New Birth you have become a reborn Spirit can I hear your that thing that died in you when Adam fell has come back to life and what was it that died in you your spirit man because after the fall Adam still had a soul he was still thinking he was still planning what to use to cover his nakedness he still had a body he was hiding but that vital link between Adam and God had been broken his Spirit you know God said the day you eat of it you shall surely die so it was the spirit of Adam that died so when you are born again it is that spirit that comes back to life so God is a spirit you are a spirit you are in the very same class with God he is somebody hearing what I'm talking about listen to this you don't carry a mortal life again mortal life is subjective to Corruptions mortal life can be perverted by his virus mortal life can be tormented by cancer but you now have eternal life could you imagine Jesus carrying answer could you imagine Jesus carrying his he said when you are confused as to the plan of God look onto Jesus is the author and the finisher of our faith look onto him whatever cannot be found in Christ that is in you I Cur them in the name of Jesus that's who you are you are a child of God you share a common life with God eternal life is what to carry not a mortal life eternal life is what to car not a temporal life that gives you worth that should give you a sense of worth it gives you the confidence required to confront oppositions shut up a child of the king is talking shut up he enough he enough shut up this is not permitted in the nature I carry now shut up he hears you that's who you are now listen to this listen very carefully the Bible says he has raised us up together with him Ephesians 2:5 and 6 and has made us to sit together with them in Heavenly places that is what happens at Redemption there is a change of your citizenry you are lifted from this Earthly realm spiritually into a Heavenly place with Christ that's what the word says now the question is what is the worth of your new status your new place your new citizenry Ephesians chapter 1:20 the Bible said Christ is seated in Heavenly places far above all principalities and powers and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come so the Heavenly places where you are seated is far above say with me far above far so you are spiritually seated far above the Realms where all principalities and powers and dominions can operate so where you are the devil cannot harass you can I hear your I said the enemy has no legal right to harass you where you are because you are seated far above him come and say far above far say loud and far above so where you are seated his a has no right to molest you where you are seated cancer has no right to humiliate you where you are seated death has no right to strike at you where you are seated is far above where they can function now you see that far above mentality will help your smartness in the demonstration of the power of God you are far above so when you are talking to the sick you are talking and praying for the sick with a far above mentality be healed in the name of Jesus be set free in the name of Jesus that's what happens he has raised you and me together with him and made us to sit together with him in Heavenly place far above all principalities and Powers far above far above far above you need a far above mentality as a child of God to keep your enemies under your feet you need a far above mentality as a child of God to keep your enemies under your feet you remember Paul the Apostle he was toying with death he said I don't know what to choose whether to go or to remain now you see to remain is more profitable for you but to go is profitable for me anyway the way you are looking I will stay now you see that is that is a man who was too confident of his position now listen the stone PA to death and they drag him out of the city and the people gathered together to plan his barrier that means they shook him he didn't shake they are spiritual people they would have prayed they opened his eye it was closed they opened his mouth it has gone together so they said well where do we bury him how do we go about it do we send for James do we stand for John how do we go about this why they were planning his barrier he stood up can you understand what I'm talking about that man was too much why because he knew his worth in Christ friends you are too far above what is tormenting you you must rise with anger tonight and say enough is enough enough is enough enough is enough enough is enough enough is enough Hallelujah is someone exited here tonight are you excited here tonight are you excited here tonight are you excited here tonight God is a spirit you are a spirit God is light isn't that in your Bible 1 John chapter 1 very he said God is light now God is light and he said ye are the light light of the world so you share that nature with him and that light shines in darkness and darkness cannot handle it so Darkness can molest you can I hear your Darkness cannot molest you Darkness cannot molest you Darkness cannot molest you before I close tonight please understand this the Bible say there was war in heaven Revelation 2 12: 7 Satan fought and his angels against Michael and prevailed not neither was there any more place found for him In Heaven There was war in heaven even though we're Heavenly places we can still experience War there was war in heaven but Satan prevailed not I'm glad to let you know where you are Satan has no power to Prevail you are seated together in Heavenly places Satan has no power to Prevail where you are now has he can be rude enough to fight but he has no right to Prevail he may be rude enough to fight but he has no right to Prevail he may be rude enough to attack you but he has no right to Prevail he said he prevailed not neither was there any place found for him in heaven he lost all the rounds he did not win any point there was no place f for him he had no marks every Mark of the devil on your life till this moment I command them blotted out forever in the name of Jesus Satan shall have no no no more mark on your destiny all the days of your life in the name of Jesus he said therefore wo unto the inhabitants of the Earth for Satan is come down unto you having great wrath because he knows know that he has but a short time but Rejoice ye heavens and all that doing so there are people dwelling in Heavens right here because the accuser of the bread has been cast down so listen in heaven where you live only joy and rejoicing is permitted therefore everything causing you sorrow I command them to come to an end tonight in the name of Jesus sorrow over your children I command them to come to an end tonight in the name of Jesus sorrow over your family I command them to come to an end tonight in the name of Jesus friends that's what it takes it takes a desperation with understanding to be r with the power of God in order to fill your destiny in a grand time and may I say this as I close the holy spirit is the principal channel of that empowerment is the principal channel of that empowerment but this is how he empowers you you want to know how he empowers you before we close tonight I'd like you to please listen to this this is how the Holy Ghost empowers you now if you look at Isaiah 11 and verse 1 to he said there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and the spirit of the Lord shall come upon him the spirit of wisdom of cancel of knowledge of the fear of the Lord of Might and shall make him of quick understanding here this God's people even though the Holy Ghost is our principle the principal channel of empowerment but he empowers Us principally by quickening our understanding in the truth and when the understanding of the truth is on you you are practically in command of the Affairs of life because he upholds all things by the word of his power how many things Hebrews 1:3 all things are at the command of the word of his power so the Holy Ghost empowers Us principally by opening our understanding into the truth and when you understand the truth you are in command of situations because when Jesus said it is written the correct one it is written rightly divided it is written then Satan need him and Angels Came and ministered unto him listen to this Paul said I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the carrier of the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes so God's power is embedded in his word and the Holy Ghost opens our understanding to assess that power so when the Holy Ghost comes on you he does not only make you carry any feeling you may not even carry no feeling but he strikes through scriptures to put in your hand what will give you the victory you require can I hear your loud when Jesus introduced the holy spirit this is what he said in John 14:26 he said when it's come he will teach you all things what will he do he will give you all kinds of feelings no he will teach you all things and it will bring to your remembrance all things as they are needed whatever you have heard from me all things so his mission is to open up our understanding into the things of God that will give us practical command of the issues of life he opens our understanding into the things of God that will give us practical command over the issues of life you have the appropriate it is written and when you come out with the appropriate scripture every devil bows up can I hear your loud because that light shines in darkness and darkness can't stop it no force in hell can stop the word of God from being effectual when the correct word is found every devil gives way when the correct word is found every devil gives away now in John 16 and verse 11-13 he said I have many things to say to you but you cannot handle them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself whatsoever shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come if you check all scriptures you find out the Holy Ghost principally opens the understanding of the Saints into the truth which gives the Saints command of the issues of Life can I hear your Amen in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:9 no man knows the things of a man but the spirit of man that is in him even so the things of God knower no man but by the spirit of God for the spirit of God ten all things say the Deep things of God the Deep things of God the Deep things of God so the Holy Ghost is our such light into the scriptures which puts us in command of the issues of Life can I hear your loud Every Act of God is a confirmation of his word so it takes a revelation of the word to commit God to confirm his word he takes a revelation of the word therefore listen to this listen very carefully Jesus has paid for your total health that means sickness is a Leger in your life he say you have been bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are the Lord Lord the price has been fully paid for your total H therefore Satan has no legal right to molest your body 1 Corinthians 6:20 now now that's a word from the Lord and that word is for someone here that your body is no longer permitted to be molested by the devil because God has fully paid the total price for your to head in Christ therefore every Mark of the devil on your body I ca them tonight in the name of Jesus everyone appointed to death by the deadly ravaging plague of his 8 I command your release tonight in the name of Jesus wherever the enemy is sitting in your home on your shoulders around your destiny and in your business I command him to take his leave now in the name of Jesus that's what happens the gospel is the power of God is the carrier of the power of God so when you assess the word the appropriate word the power of God is made manifest and Satan cannot say no I said Satan cannot say no I said Satan cannot say no I said Satan cannot say no I said Satan cannot say no somebody's going hope tonight with a spark of God's fire on his life you will sleep tonight the way you have never slept before God's power will lay to rest every struggle of your life that's what it takes so what are we doing with we are thirsty for the power of God we want to fulfill Destiny we want to subdue our enemies under our feet and we want to have the privilege of the appropriate scripture part time to deal with the issues confronting us and when that happens Dominion is established in a grand sty friends you have what it takes to fulfill Destiny if you will ever care for it you have all all it takes as we begin to draw to a close tonight i like to give an opportunity to people in this Great summit tonight because the greatest Miracle On Earth Is the miracle of Salvation that is your rescue from this wicked world the Bible says how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation may I say this before we close before I invite you to be prayed for after the fall of Man man was reduced to dust he said for dust Thou Art and unto dust shall thou return before the fall man was molded from the dust and he became a living Soul after the fall he was reduced to dust and remember Jesus the Lord said to Satan he said upon thy belly shall thou go the days of thy life and dust shall be thy food so from the fall Man became a slave of the devil that's why the Bible said the God of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not so he became the God of this world he had the legal right to do whatever he like with everyone that is unregenerate everyone that is unredeemed so before you are born again you are a is meat to the devil he does whatever he likes at any time he likes Redemption is your only authentic escape from that word of wickedness you can't be in the government of the wicked and have joy when the wicked Ru the people mourn when you are in his government you are depressed when you're under his government you sorrow when you're under his government you cannot be excited because the government of the wicked forbids excitement and joy he does whatever he lies with the children of this world but when you are saved you have escaped I know there are people here who need to run for an escape tonight wherever you are you want to be born again you want to be become a child of God this is one grand opportunity for you until you are born again you are not entitled to his empowerment salvation is the great qualification for his empowerment wherever you are before I pray for people tonight i like you to stand to your feet you want to be born again tonight you want to be saved you want to become a child of God please stand to your feet wherever you are and I will pray with you Jesus said except you are born again you cannot see the kingdom of God you cannot see the kingdom of God except you are born again you cannot see the kingdom of God the power of God is real everyone in front please bow your heads as I lead you in prayer and pray this prayer of faith after me say with me Lord Jesus say It L Lord Jesus I accept you tonight as my Lord and my savior I believe you died for me on the third day you Rose again that I might be just if right now I believe I am forgiven I'm Justified I'm saved I'm born again I'm a Child of God thank you Lord for saving me I pray for you now Heavenly Father Your Grace has brought these precious people let the same Grace preserve them Lord keep them Lord until the end of the times in Jesus precious name all we have done tonight is to explore the secret of empowerment and I know inside me that Satan will no longer take you for a right from tonight whatever tree my heavenly father has not planted that is growing in your life I command them uprooted tonight in the name of Jesus whatever tree my heavenly father is not planted that is growing in your family I command them uprooted tonight in the name of Jesus whatever tree my heavenly father is not planted that is growing in your body I command them uproot it tonight in the name of Jesus every handwriting that is against you which is contrary to you I command them taken out of the way tonight in the name of Jesus every medical verdict against your destiny I command them reverted tonight in the name of Jesus listen the Lord said to me the Harvest of Africa is now override rushing and preserve it from decadence therefore in the eyes of God and one of his agents of preservation whatever is out to destroy your destiny I command them destroy tonight in the name of Jesus he said to me but from the beginning it was not so and now the hour has come to liberate the word from all operations of the devil through the preaching of the word of faith and I'm sending you to undertake this task whatever was not so from the beginning that is now so in your body that is now so in your family that is now so in your career that is not so in your destiny I command them uprooted in the name of Jesus I command them uprooted in the name of Jesus I command them uprooted in the name of Jesus thank you father in Jesus precious name\"},)"
