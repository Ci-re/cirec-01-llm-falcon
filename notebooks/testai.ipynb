       "'## The Dominion Within: A Sermon on Inherent Power\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, have you ever felt inadequate? Like you’re lacking something essential to live the victorious life God has promised?  Have you felt the pressure of the world, the whispers of doubt, telling you that you’re not enough? This morning, we’re going to talk about dominion, a word that resonates with power, authority, and control. But more importantly, we’re going to uncover the dominion that already resides *within* you.\\n\\nOur text today draws inspiration from Psalm 114, a powerful declaration of God’s dominion and the inheritance of His people.  \"When Israel went out of Egypt… Judah was his sanctuary and Israel his dominion.\" The sea fled, Jordan was driven back, mountains skipped like rams! This wasn’t through their own strength, but through the presence of God *with* them. This speaks to a fundamental truth: our dominion is rooted in our relationship with the Almighty.\\n\\nWe also heard today about awareness, about being conscious of the power we carry. This awareness, this consciousness, is not arrogance; it’s recognizing the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit. Just as the minister mentioned, “There are things you can\\'t take from me. I don\\'t care how dead an atmosphere is. I\\'m aware when I show up it will tilt because God will show up.” This isn’t about self-promotion; it’s about God-promotion through the vessel He has chosen—you!\\n\\nThe enemy’s greatest trick, as highlighted in Genesis 3, is convincing us that we lack what we already possess. He tries to sell us back what is rightfully ours, creating a cycle of striving, anxiety, and dependence on things outside of God. He pressures us to chase after illusions of power and control, when true dominion lies within, a gift from our Creator.\\n\\nThink of Peter at the Beautiful Gate. He didn\\'t have silver or gold, the currency of earthly power. But he possessed something far greater: the power of God within him.  He said, \"Such as I have give I thee.\" And with that declaration, a miracle took place.\\n\\nWhat do *you* have? You have the Holy Spirit. You have the promises of God. You have access to the same power that parted the Red Sea and moved mountains. You have a dominion that is not earned but inherited, a birthright as a child of the King.\\n\\nDon’t be afraid.  Don’t be intimidated by the challenges you face. Don’t buy into the lie that you are lacking. Instead, become *aware* of who you are in Christ.  Recognize the power residing within you.  Like Abraham, look up at the stars and remember the promise – your descendants, your impact, your dominion, will be too numerous to count.\\n\\nGod has gone before you. He has prepared the way.  He has placed within you everything you need to walk in victory and fulfill your divine purpose.  So, I ask you again, are you aware? Are you ready to step into the fullness of the dominion that is already yours?\\n\\nLet us pray that the Holy Spirit will open our eyes to see the truth of who we are in Christ, powerful and victorious, walking in the dominion He has ordained for each and every one of us. Amen.\\n'"
